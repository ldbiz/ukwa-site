For almost half a century police authorities in England and Wales fulfilled their role of ensuring that the public had an efficient and effective local police force. This system was replaced by a single elected individual (a Police & Crime Commissioner) following the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, and elections on Thursday 15th November 2012. This collection contains snapshots of all 41 police authority sites at or near the changeover date of 20th November. It also includes sites from the newly elected Police and Crime Commissioners, and selected sites relating to the first elections of 2012. It also includes the sites of the police forces and associated organisations in Scotland superseded by the Police Service of Scotland from April 2013, under the terms of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012.
