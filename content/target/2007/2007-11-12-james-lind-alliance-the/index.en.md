The James Lind Alliance aims to identify the most important gaps in knowledge about the effects of treatments, and has been established to bring patients and clinicians together in 'Working Partnerships' to identify and prioritise the unanswered questions that they agree are most important. This information will help ensure that those who fund health research are aware of what matters to patients and clinicians
