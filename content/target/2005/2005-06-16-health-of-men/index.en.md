The present day HOM project is a 5 year Big Lottery Fund initiative which addresses the neglected area of mens health and the inequalities which result from this historic lack of attention across the Bradford and Airedale district. The project is delivering health services to suit boys and mens needs within the community and in environments which are non threatening and comfortable to men and outside of traditional health settings, i.e. Pubs, barbershops, retail outlets, betting shops, sporting clubs and other various male oriented venues.
