Arthritis Action was founded in 1942 in Bournemouth by Charles de Coti-Marsh along with a group of 49 people who had gained relief from the pain of arthritis by following a self-help programme he had developed based on a combination of diet and physical therapy. It became a registered charity in 1985.
