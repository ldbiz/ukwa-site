The Potteries Tile Trail celebrates tiles and architectural ceramics to be found in locations across Stoke-on-Trent. It aims to promote the city's built environment as well as its internationally significant tile and architectural ceramic industry. This virtual collection has been created in partnership with volunteer research teams, the local community and a wider constituency of online contributors. Six introductory trails or 'tours' can be accessed via dedicated channel using the Historypin website or smart phone app. There are six 'tile trails' - one for each of Stoke-on-Trent's towns: Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. The trails are aimed at local residents and visitors alike. They offer a selection of varied and interesting ceramics to be found on buildings and public spaces local to each neighbourhood. The project was devised and delivered by Danny Callaghan.
