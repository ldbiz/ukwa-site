The Map of Early Modern London is comprised of four distinct, interoperable projects: a digital Map and gazetteer based on the 1560s Agas woodcut map of London; an Encyclopedia of London people, places, topics, and terms; a Library of marked-up texts rich in London toponyms; and a versioned edition of John Stowâ€™s Survey of London. All of the files in the databases use a common TEI tagset that enables them to work with primary and secondary texts simultaneously. The project is led by Janelle Jenstad, a Canadian academic.
