The Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) champions the environment and landscapes of Wales and its coastal waters as sources of natural and cultural riches, as a foundation for economic and social activity, and as a place for leisure and learning opportunities. From 01 April 2013, Natural Resources Wales will take over the functions currently carried out by the Countryside Council for Wales and Forestry Commission Wales, the devolved functions of Environment Agency Wales and some functions that are currently carried out within the Welsh Government.
