The school maintain the belief that they must help their children to be ‘expert learners’. Every child has success within them and their aim is to provide a stimulating environment where children can achieve their own success. They need to learn how to learn. Expert learners are self-aware, have faith in their ability to learn new skills and judge how their new skills will be needed. They know that learning is for life.
