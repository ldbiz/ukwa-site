The Coventry Telegraph is a local English tabloid newspaper. Founded originally as The Midland Daily Telegraph in 1891 it changed its name to the Coventry Evening Telegraph on 17 November 1941, and then the Coventry Telegraph on 2 October 2006 (which reflected its switch to morning publication). The newspaper became a part of the then Mirror Group (prior to its merger with Trinity to become Trinity Mirror), in 1997.
