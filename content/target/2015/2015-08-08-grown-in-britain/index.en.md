Grown in Britain is creating new sustainably managed woodland to increase the supply of British timber destined for use by local people and businesses. Grown in Britain is a movement designed to help create a sustainable wood culture that connects people, companies and organisations to our woods and forests and the important environment they provide for people, wildlife and a thriving economy.
