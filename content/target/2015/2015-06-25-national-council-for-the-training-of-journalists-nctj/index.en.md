National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) was founded in 1951 to run the newspaper industryâ€™s training scheme, following the findings of a Royal Commission on the Press. Now a charity for all media, the organisation has a professional awarding body, an accreditation board, Student Council, focus groups and forums, and the annual Journalism Skills Conference.
