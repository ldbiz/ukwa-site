The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) was founded in 1946 to promote the study and teaching of social anthropology, to present the interests of social anthropology and to maintain its professional status. Its aim is to assist in planning research, to collate and publish information on social anthropology and to function as a register of social anthropologists. The ASA publishes the annual ASA monograph, the directory of members, the peer-reviewed open access journal: ASAonline, the FIrth lectures, and a blog.
