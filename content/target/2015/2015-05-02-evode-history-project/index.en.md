The Evode Group of Companies began as Spic and Span Shoe Polishes Ltd of Glover Street, Stafford, which was incorporated on 3 June 1932 and partly owned by Lotus Ltd, the shoe manufacturers. The Glover Street premises was subject to flooding, and had only five staff and Â£30 worth of equipment when Dr Hermann Simon joined the Company as a director and chemist in 1937 from Germany, where he was a successful manufacturer of protective paints and waterproofing compounds. In the early years he made use of a gas burner and a collection of saucepans to develop his products. He was to head the Company until his death in 1978. On joining the Company he expanded the product range by adding building chemicals and, soon after his arrival, its name was changed to Spic and Span Chemical Products Ltd, which was incorporated on 19 May 1938. Later the same year the name was changed yet again to Dove Chemical Products Ltd because the Dove brand of polish was the company's most successful and well-known product. The company was incorporated on 12 October 1938. However the new name was found to infringe the trade mark rights of an existing company and the name was reversed to become Evode Chemical Works Ltd on 13 February 1940.
In the same year Dr Simon was interned, as were all German Nationals during the Second World War. During his absence the firm was forced to move from its original premises in Glover Street to a derelict shoe factory in Stone Road. Representations made on Dr Simon's behalf to the government resulted in him being released after only nine months and he returned to the Company to develop, manufacture and supply the government with important sealants, protective paints and waterproofing compounds, which aided the war effort, particularly with the construction of airfield runways being laid in winter. During this period the Company expanded rapidly and became an established business. Its name was shortened to Evode Ltd on 20 June 1949. The following year, land was purchased on Common Road, Stafford, on the site of a former brick works. A building programme was started then which lasted more than a decade, as the Company expanded and its accommodation was extended and improved.
The Company was floated on the stock exchange in 1963 and became Evode Holdings Ltd. This was a holding company for Evode Ltd and the expanding number of subsidiary and associate companies in the Group. In 1981 the Company was re-registered as a public company and became Evode Holdings plc. A final name change in 1982 saw the company become Evode Group plc. During the 1980s it expanded its range of products to include plastics. It was acquired by Laporte plc in 1993, then by Ato Findley in 1996, and became part of Elf Aquitaine, then the fourth largest adhesive and sealant manufacturer in the world.
The company was owned by Bostik Findley, following the merger of the two parent companies in 2000, but has since been sold again (information in 2015).
