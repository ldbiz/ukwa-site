The Worshipful Company of Butchers is one of the seven oldest of the City of London Livery Companies and it was granted its Royal Charter of Incorporation by King James 1 in 1605. The Company is active within the City of London and the meat industry.  It also facilitates the development of butchery skills through competitions, courses and apprenticeships while funding bursaries for the Postgraduate Meat Management Diploma at Harper Adams University and supporting Nuffield Scholarships.
