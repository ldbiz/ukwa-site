This is a UK Government initiative that seeks to provide a detailed audit of EU activities and how they affect the UK. Government departments contribute to the review, which will draw also on EU institutions and partners, UK Parliament and civil society organisations. The website provides links to completed reports, details of the programme of work, and information on how to contribute to the review.
