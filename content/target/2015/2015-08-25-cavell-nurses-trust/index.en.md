Cavell Nurses' Trust provides vital support to all UK nurses during very difficult times. It offers help to registered nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, student nurses and retired nurses. Cavell Nurses' Trust, formerly known as NurseAid, was originally set up in 1917 following the public outcry that followed the death of Edith Cavell. Many members of the public sent donations in memory of Edith and these formed a source of funds that are still used to help nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants in their time of need.
