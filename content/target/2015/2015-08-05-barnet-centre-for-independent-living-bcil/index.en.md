The Barnet Centre for Independent Living (BCIL) is a peer-led organisation that promotes accessibility for disabled people by breaking down barriers to employment and social inclusion. It aims to provide a peer-led, multi-service one-stop-shop for people with any form of disability living or working in the London Borough of Barnet.
