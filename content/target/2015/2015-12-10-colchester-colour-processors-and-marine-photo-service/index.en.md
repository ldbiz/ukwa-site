Site was set up initially to support a reunion of a group of shipboard photographers who travelled the world taking photos over several decades. Contains some rare photos of Brits working at sea on foreign vessels - historical shots of ports of the world as well as a collection of  Cruise Ship photos. Two reunions have taken place during the life of the website (about 8 years).
