With the centenary of the First World War the ILN Ltd, the custodians of the 'Illustrated London News' and 'Great Eight Illustrated Magazine' collection archives, made the 1914-18 archives available to the public for research, education and pleasure. With the help of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Illustrated First World War website was created.
