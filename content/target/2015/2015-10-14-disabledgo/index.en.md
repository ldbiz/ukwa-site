DisabledGo provides information to thousands of venues across the UK and the Republic of Ireland: shops, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, railway stations, hotels, universities, hospitals and more. Their mission is to maximise independence and choice for disabled people in accessing their local area and the places all want to visit.
