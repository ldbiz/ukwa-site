CCN is a network of 37 County Councils and Unitary authorities that serve county areas. CCN is a member led organisation, and works on an inclusive and all party basis. CCN Council and Executive Committees include Councillors from each of our member authorities. CCN recognises that member authorities must have the right to respond to their communities in different ways and seeks to make representations to government which can be supported by all member authorities.
