Ousekjarr is the name of the Cambridge group of The Vikings, a middle ages re-enactment society. They recreate the life and military history of the Vikings, Saxons, Celts and Normans between 800-1100AD. The name means "brushwood island in the river Ouse", and is based on the time in the 10th Century when Cambridge was the furthest extent of the Danelaw.
