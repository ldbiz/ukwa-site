<p>The UK Health and Environmental Research Institute (UK-HERI) is part of a Research &amp; Technology Development Group employing over 150 scientists and engineers, and containing five individual institutes, each with a specific technological specialism and competence. They provide a package of support to all types of companies, particularly small and medium sized companies (SMEs). This includes services of research and development from initial concept generation through knowledge and technology development and ultimately assistance with market stimulation and commercialisation. They also selectively choose to co-invest with industry to help build techno-economic feasibility studies and it is their policy to not hold intellectual property.</p>
