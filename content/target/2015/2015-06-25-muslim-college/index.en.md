The Muslim College is different from most other institutions offering Islamic Studies because it employs both Western and traditional scholarship in the medium of English. We do not favour or subscribe to any particular denomination of Islam. We allow for equality of the sexes, where men and women are taught together and are encouraged to fully participate in classes. We also allow people of all (or no) faiths to come and study at our institution.The Muslim College envisages to provide continued excellence in Islamic academia and thus regularly reviews and develops its programmes.Our underlying ethos at the college is to imbibe a progressive approach to religion in our students.
