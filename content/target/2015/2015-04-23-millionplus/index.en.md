MillionPlus, formerly known as the Campaign for Mainstream Universities and the Coalition of Modern Universities (CMU), is a membership organisation, which aims to promote the role of "modern universities" in the UK higher education system; it describes itself as "The Association for Modern Universities in the UK". MillionPlus is funded by subscriptions from its members, currently 19 UK universities. While all of the member institutions are "new" universities, many have long histories as colleges and polytechnics.
