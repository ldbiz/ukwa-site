The Great War Symphony is a a choral symphony in four movements with each movement depicting a year of the First World War.  It is being written by composer Patrick Hawes.  Remember WWI, the UK-wide community engagement project supported by the Department for Communities & Local Government, has adopted the symphony as their official music and Patrick as their Official Composer. Two parts from each of the movements are to be recorded in June 2015 at Abbey Road Studios with the National Youth Choir of Great Britain and the English Session Orchestra, and these movements will be heard first on Classic FM. The complete work will be premiered in 2018 as part of the Remember WWI commemorations to mark the end of the centenary and will involve community choirs and musicians across the UK.
