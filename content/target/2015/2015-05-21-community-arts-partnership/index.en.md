Community Arts Partnership was formed in 2011 and is the new trading name of New Belfast Community Arts Initiative (New Belfast), after its merger with Community Arts Forum (CAF). They take the lead in the promotion, development and delivery of community arts practice, in the belief that the arts can transform the society at a cultural, social and economic level. They support and collaborate with community groups, centres of learning, artists, arts centres and other organisations in Northern Ireland and beyond.
