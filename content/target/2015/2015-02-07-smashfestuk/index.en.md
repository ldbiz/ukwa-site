<p>SMASHfestUK, is a science and arts festival for young people, piloting in Deptford, South East London during the February half term holidays (14th February – 22nd February 2015). Part sci-­fi, part horror and part post-apocalyptic-nightmare, the festival is themed around a gripping story in which an asteroid is on a collision course with Planet Earth and a zombie invasion ensues. SMASHfestUK is the creation of science TV production company The Refinery, and is partnered by the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, the Wellcome Trust, Middlesex University, and the Royal Observatory Greenwich.<br />
The UK Web Archive contributes to the festival as well.</p>
