Prospect Burma was set up in 1989 in the aftermath of the military regime’s suppression of mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Burma in 1988. At that time thousands of young Burmese fled to Burma's borders, and universities and schools were closed down. Prospect Burma’s scholarship programme has awarded some 1,500 scholarships since that time and opens doors to educational opportunities currently unavailable and underfunded within Burma.
