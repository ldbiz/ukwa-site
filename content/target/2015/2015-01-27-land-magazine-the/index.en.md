<p>'The Land Magazine - an occasional magazine about land rights' is written by and for people who believe that the roots of justice, freedom, social security and democracy lie in access to land and its resources. The Land reflects the preoccupations of two previous publications: 'The Land Is Ours Newsletter', which for nine years informed people about land campaigns in the UK and abroad, and 'Chapter 7 News', which since 1999 has published news and views about the UK planning system.</p>
