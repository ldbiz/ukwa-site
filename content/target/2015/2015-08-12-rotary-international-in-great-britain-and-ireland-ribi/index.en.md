Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (RIBI) is the association of Rotary clubs within England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The clubs are based in local communities where members meet on a regular basis to enjoy friendship, networking and to plan projects that will benefit the lives of others. They focus their efforts in six areas: promoting peace, preventing diseases, providing access to clean water and sanitation, enhancing maternal and child health, improving basic education and literacy, and helping communities develop.
