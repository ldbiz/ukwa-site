The I-WIRE (Integrated Workflow for Institutional Repository Enhancement) Project was funded by the JISC Information Environment 2009-2011 (INF11) programme. The project has developed a workflow and toolset, integrated into Cardiff Portal, for the submission, indexing, and re-purposing of research outputs in Cardiff University's Institutional Repository ORCA (Online Research @ Cardiff).
