Poetry NI seeks to promote Northern Irish poetry on a grassroots level. They run FourXFour, a quarterly online journal that exclusively focuses on poets either born in, or currently residing long-term in, Northern Ireland. They also have a print publishing wing, Pen Points Press, which issues broadsides and chapbooks.
