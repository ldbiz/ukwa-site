Wound Care Alliance UK was established after disolvement of the Wound Care Society (WCS) and Tissue Viability Nurses Association (TVNA). Wound Care Alliance hopes to nurture healthcare professionals working at a basic level and encourage them to pursue their education within tissue viability, bringing forward the Tissue Viability Nurses, Podiatrists and therapists of the future.
