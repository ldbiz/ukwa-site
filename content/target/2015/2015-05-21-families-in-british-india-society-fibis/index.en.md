The Families In British India Society (FIBIS) is an organisation devoted to members with an interest in researching their ancestors who lived in British India. The Society was formed in November 1998 to provide a resource for people researching families and their social history in India from 1600 up to, and even after, Indian Independence in 1947. The Societyâ€™s primary aim is to helping individuals research their ancestors and the social structure in which they lived.
