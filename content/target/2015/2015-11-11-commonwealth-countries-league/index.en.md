The Commonwealth Countries League involves people helping others who are in need, or those who are destitute, with acts of kindness. The Commonwealth Countries League is a voluntary pan-Commonwealth civil society organisation. It was founded in 1925 by a group of women from many countries which make up todayâ€™s Commonwealth.
