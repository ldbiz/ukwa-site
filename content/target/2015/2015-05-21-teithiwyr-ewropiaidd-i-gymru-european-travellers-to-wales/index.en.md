European Travellers to Wales is a three-year Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded project looks  into the various portrayals of Wales and ‘Welshness’ in European travel writing in the period 1750-2010. The project is a collaboration between Bangor University, University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Swansea University.
