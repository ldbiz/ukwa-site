Conflict and Politics in Northern Ireland (CAIN) is a site which provides a wide range of information and source material on the Northern Ireland conflict and politics in the region from 1968 to the present. The site also contains some general information on Northern Ireland society. The CAIN Project began in 1996 and the Web site was first made available on-line in March 1997.
