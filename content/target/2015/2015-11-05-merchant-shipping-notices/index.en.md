Merchant shipping Notices MSNs contain the technical detail of regulations called ‘statutory instruments’ (SIs). This is mandatory information, and must be complied with under UK legislation. The letter suffix after the M-notice number tells you if it relates to merchant ships and/or fishing vessels: (M) for merchant ship; (F) for fishing vessels; (M+F) for both merchant ships and fishing vessels
