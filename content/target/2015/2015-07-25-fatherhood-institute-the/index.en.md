The Fatherhood Institute is the UK’s fatherhood think-and-do-tank and a registered charity. The Fatherhood Institute’s vision is a society that gives all children a strong and positive relationship with their father and any father-figures; supports both mothers and fathers as earners and carers; and prepares boys and girls for a future shared role in caring for children.
