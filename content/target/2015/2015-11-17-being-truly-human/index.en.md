The website of the Phiroz Mehta Trust, UK registered charity no. 328061. The Trust was formed in 1988, arising from the wishes of a group of students associated with the work of Phiroz Mehta, the Indian-born writer and lecturer on religious topics. The website contains a catalogue of around 850 of Phiroz's talks, all of which are available free for online or offline listening. There is also a full archive of the Trust's newsletter, through which transcripts of many of Phiroz's talks are available.
