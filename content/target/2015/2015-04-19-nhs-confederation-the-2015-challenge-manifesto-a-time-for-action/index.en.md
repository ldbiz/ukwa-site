The NHS Confederation is the only membership body that brings together and speaks on behalf of all organisations that plan, commission and provide NHS services. Their members are drawn from every part of the health and care system and join 560+ organisations connected to the NHS Confederation.

We have three roles - to be an influential system leader; to represent our members with politicians, national bodies, the unions and in Europe; and to support our members to continually improve care for patients and the public.
