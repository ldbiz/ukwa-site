Cardiff Taffs Community Currency is a community-based group in which people exchange all kinds of goods and services with each another, using online community credits and paper Taffs notes that can be withdrawn at Taffs trading sessions. Cardiff Taffs was established in 2010, as the economic downturn began to bite.
