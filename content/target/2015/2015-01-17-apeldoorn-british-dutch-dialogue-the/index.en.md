<p>The Apeldoorn: British-Dutch Dialogue Conference Series takes its name from the Dutch city of Apeldoorn, where the first ever conference took place in 2000 and have become a forum where influential commentators, policymakers, politicians, business leaders, academics and civil society representatives from the UK and the Netherlands come together to pool ideas, expertise and best practice, and create lasting relationships, alliances and networks. Conferences take place on an annual basis, alternating between the UK and Holland; they tackle a different contemporary theme each year. The Conference Series is jointly organised by the British Council Netherlands, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
