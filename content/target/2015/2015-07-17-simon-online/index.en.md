Simon Online is a collaborative edition of Simon of Genoa's 'Clavis sanationis', a medical dictionary from the late 13th century (Latin-Greek-Arabic). The site owners edit, translate and provide a commentary. The language of the website is English, the editing process takes place in the UK, and most contributions are written in the UK. The website presents a novel way of sharing research data, as all raw material was made accessible straight away. Moreover, they edit the text in a flowing system. The project is funded by a Wellcome Trust University Award.
