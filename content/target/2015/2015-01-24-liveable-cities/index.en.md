<p>Liveable Cities is a five-year programme of research to develop a method of designing and engineering UK cities that take cognisance of one planet living, one world resources and individual and societal wellbeing. This will be achieved via the development of a unique City Analysis Methodology (CAM) that will measure how cities operate and perform in terms of their people, environment and governance, taking account of wellbeing and resource security. The project is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).</p>
