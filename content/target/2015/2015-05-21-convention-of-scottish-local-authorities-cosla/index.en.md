The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) is the representative voice of Scottish local government, lobbying on behalf of their members. It was formed in 1975. They promote and protect the interests of councils in Scotland and the people and communities they serve by representing their views to Scottish, UK and European governments and legislatures, other bodies and the public. Their priorities include promoting the role of local government as a vital sphere of government in Scotland; championing local services, local leadership and local accountability; and working with the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament to influence public policy and to fight for resources.
