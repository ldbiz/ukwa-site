<p>The Library and Information History Group (LIHG) was formed in 1962. It is one of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals' (CILIP) oldest special interest groups and is the only group in the UK specifically devoted to the history of libraries and librarianship. The LIHG publishes a regular newsletter, and a scholarly journal, Library &amp; Information History, appears under its aegis.</p>
