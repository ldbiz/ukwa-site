The British-German Environment Forum (BGEF) was launched in 1997, inspired by the tradition of Anglo-German ‘Königswinter’ conferences, which have made a contribution to political understanding and cooperation between Germany and Britain since the war. It has also a new focus: it acts as a catalyst for fresh thinking and action on the challenge of environmentally sustainable development.
