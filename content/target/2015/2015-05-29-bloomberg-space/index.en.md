Bloomberg Space is not a conventional corporate art collection, but rather a dynamic space, where artists and audiences can explore new ideas and relationships in an innovative way.  In May 2002, Bloomberg L.P. opened its own gallery called Bloomberg SPACE dedicated to commissioning and exhibiting contemporary art within its European headquarters in London.
