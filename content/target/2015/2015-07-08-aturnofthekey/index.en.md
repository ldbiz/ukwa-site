The website relates to St Georgeâ€™s Hospital, formerly Stafford County Asylum, which was one of the earliest in the country opening in 1818. The early buildings were abandoned some years ago and allowed to fall into disrepair, and be the target of vandalism, which has been a major local concern because the site is fairly central in the town. In the grounds there is now new housing built, and the hospital buildings that can be saved are also now under development, so there is renewed local interest, and the grounds are now open for people to get a much closer look after years of being boarded up.
