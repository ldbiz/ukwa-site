The Labour Land Campaign advocates a more equitable distribution of the Land Values that are created by the whole community. It is a voluntary group working for land reform within the Labour Movement. Members of the campaign are members of the Labour Party, Trade Unions and Cooperatives, or individuals who support the aim to share land wealth through Land Value Taxation.
