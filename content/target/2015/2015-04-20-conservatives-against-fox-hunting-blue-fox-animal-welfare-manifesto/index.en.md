Conservatives Against Fox Hunting (The Blue Fox Group)  established by a The Conservative Association Chairman, (now the Association Vice President and his family in January 2010). This web site is here to represent the two thirds of Conservative supporters  and the 80% of the general population who think hunting should remain illegal as demonstrated in an Ipsos MORI poll carried out for The League Against Cruel Sports.
