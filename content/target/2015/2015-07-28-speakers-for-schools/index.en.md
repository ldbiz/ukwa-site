Speakers for Schools is a UK charity launched in 2011, providing state secondary schools and colleges with talks from a range of industry leading professionals, public figures and academics, free of charge. The network currently consists of 950 speakers who donate their time to go into state schools to share their insights, experiences and more about their area of expertise as leaders in their fields through high-profile assembly talks with students.
