The Rulebook publishes rules made by the PRA under powers conferred by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). The Rulebook applies to all PRA-authorised persons (and in some cases, unauthorised persons and individuals) and contains the prudential requirements relevant to them. The Rulebook contains the most accessible version of the PRAâ€™s rules which are consolidated on a regular basis. The definitive rules are always contained in the PRA's rule-making instruments.
