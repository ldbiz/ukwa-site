Barnsley War Memorials Project exists to record for posterity the names of all the Barnsley fallen from the Boer War and the First World War to the present day; to make those names available for everyone to search in a Roll of Honour online and on paper in Barnsley Archives and to record the monuments and memorials which have been erected to the Barnsley fallen wherever they may be.
