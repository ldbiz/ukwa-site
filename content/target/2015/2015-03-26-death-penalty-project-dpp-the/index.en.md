The Death Penalty Project (DPP) began in 1992 when Saul Lehrfreund joined law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton to work specifically on death row cases with the late Bernard Simons. Parvais Jabbar joined soon afterwards. In 2006, The Death Penalty Project Limited was formed with its sister charity, The Death Penalty Charitable Trust. The charitable status has enabled the DPP to apply for grants from a diverse range of funders and it is now supported by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, as well as a number of charitable foundations.
