Military History Monthly is a monthly magazine that brings the battles to life with action-packed narrative. They publish the real stories of the heroes, both celebrated and forgotten, and battles and feats of daring on land, at sea, and in the air. The main focus of Military History Monthly is on Britain’s own military history, and 20th century conflicts, but it also reports on both the battles that affected the lives of earlier generations too – and the conflicts that Britain is involved in today.
