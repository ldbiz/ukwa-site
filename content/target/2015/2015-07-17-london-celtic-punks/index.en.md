London Celtic Punks is a group of people living in and around London town that run a celtic-punk gig collective. That is the traditional folk music of the Celtic nations (Ireland/Eire, Isle Of Man/Mannin, Scotland/Alba, Wales/Cymru, Cornwall/Kernow, Brittany/Breizh, Galicia/Galiza and Astures) mixed with rock and punk. They help bands with gigs and to promote Celtic-punk and Celtic music and culture.
