From Maurice John Fisher, site owner: "My site contains around 15 years of research into a number of UK photographic companies; how they formed and operated, the latter in the pre-digital era.  A major inclusion is the Ilford company, from its formation in the late 19th century to the current day.  I also include an in-depth chronology of colour film and its processing within the UK, including UK colour processes which have long disappeared e.g Pakolor, Synthacolor and Raycolor.  More recently an e-friend has provided me with his in-depth experiences of colour processes from Kodak, Agfa & Gevaert.
I also use my site as a convenient receptacle for information on scientific principles and extinct research establishments (BCURA) to do with coal research and especially 'shallow bed' fluidised bed combustion of coal as developed exclusively in the UK."
