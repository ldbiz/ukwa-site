Bitesize is the name given to the BBC's free online study support resource for school-age students in the United Kingdom. It is designed to aid students in both school work and, for older students, exams.Nominated by a Smashfest 2015 visitor, who commented:basically got me through my GCSE exams. The videos and games are on point and provide some less challenging ways of learning than reading notes.
