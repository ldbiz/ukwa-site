The exhibition 'Treasures of the Bodleian' was open to the public from 30 Sept 2011 to 23 Dec 2011. It brought together some of the rarest, most important and most evocative objects in the world. It also asked the question, 'what is a treasure in the twenty-first century?' The debate remains open on this website.
