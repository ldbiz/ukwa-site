'Disability and Industrial Society' is funded by the Wellcome Trust and ask how understandings and experiences of disability were affected by industrial development from the late eighteenth century until the end of the Second World War. Since coal mining was associated with particularly high accident rates and widespread workplace diseases, the project focuses on the coal industry and compares three coalfields in south Wales, north east England and central Scotland.
