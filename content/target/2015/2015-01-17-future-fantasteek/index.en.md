<p>Future Fantasteek! brings together a trichotomy of investigation; art-zines and independent publishing; artist as social commentator and drawing as a means of immediate visual communication. The series explores boundaries between journalism and authorial illustration using satire to reflect notions of ‘Britishness’.</p>
