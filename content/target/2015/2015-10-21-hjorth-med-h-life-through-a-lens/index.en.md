This photographic blog was started during Johannes Hjorth's time as a postdoc at University of Cambridge. It has a large set of photos from the student theatre productions at the ADC Theatre, Corpus Playroom and various other small venues in Cambridge. There are photos of close to 100 theatre shows and concerts and the blog has had over 130,000 visitors since 2014. The blog also includes photos from sports and other activities that took place there. Currently he lives in Stockholm, but regularly returns to Cambridge and adds UK related material to the blog.
