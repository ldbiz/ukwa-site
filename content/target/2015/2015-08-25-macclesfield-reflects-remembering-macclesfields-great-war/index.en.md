A web-based copy of all the research undertaken into the lives of people in the Macclesfield area during the First World War. The main focus is those who are named on the war memorials, but all the VADs, newspaper reports of things that were going on in Macclesfield at the time, personal letters and any relevant information given by private individuals will be included. The site also includes a page about each war memorial: where it was originally located (and a photo of the building), where it is now, when it was dedicated, etc.
