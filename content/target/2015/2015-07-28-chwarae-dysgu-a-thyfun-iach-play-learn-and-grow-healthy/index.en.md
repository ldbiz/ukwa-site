The Carmarthenshire Play Learn and Grow Healthy project, (based in Ammanford/Carmarthen/Llanelli/Newcastle Emlyn), is a 3-year ‘Healthy Friends’ theme project, working primarily with children aged 7/8 and 10/11 through a ‘buddying’ project, and extending to reach younger children and their families from 2 upwards. The project is aimed at raising awareness of the value of physical activity/healthy eating and introduce ideas for ‘buddying’ in a traditionally non-educational environment.' - website.
