Everyone understands inequality, a sense of injustice, a lack of opportunity. Here at Orphans in Need we live with them every day and are committed to reducing the impact where we can. But these obstructions are more than mere words; they come alive in the shape of orphaned children who live with these burdens everyday of their lives. Regrettably everyday could mean forever.

But Orphans in Need works to change forever to never. The orphans we support are real, vulnerable children whose lives are being turned around; possibilities are becoming probabilities for more and more. Read below to discover achievable success stories through the support of people like you.
