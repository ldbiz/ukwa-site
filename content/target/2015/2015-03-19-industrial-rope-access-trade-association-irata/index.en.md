The Industrial Rope Access Trade Association (IRATA), was formed in the UK in the late 1980â€™s, to solve maintenance problems in the offshore oil and gas industry. IRATA has now come to be used in a wide range of repair, maintenance, inspection and access work. It provides a safety record, a quick set-up and dismantling time, positive environmental benefits and no need for invasive access equipment or disruption of the site.
