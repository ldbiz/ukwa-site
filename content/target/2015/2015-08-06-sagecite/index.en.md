SageCite was a JISC-funded project that would develop and test a Citation Framework linking data, methods and publications. The domain of bio-informatics provides a case study, and the project builds on existing infrastructure and tools: myExperiment and the Sage Commons. The project was funded between August 2010 and July 2011.
