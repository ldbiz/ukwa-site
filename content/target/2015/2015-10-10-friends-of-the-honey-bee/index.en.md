Friends of the Honey Bee is a national campaign organised by the British Beekeepers Association. They work to build a better future for Britainâ€™s honey bees and other pollinators by planting more pollen-rich environments, encouraging others to plant for the honey bees and funding research into the varroa mite and honey bee health.
