This digital history project explores life in Powys in 1891, and compares this with the present day. All information and material for 1891 has been drawn from collections throughout the county. For the contemporary part of the project, people of Powys were asked to keep a diary of their day on 24 September 2002. Powys: A Day in the Life is funded jointly by the New Opportunities Fund and Powys County Council.
