The ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement centre uniting development studies with science and technology studies. Their work covers agriculture & food; energy & climate change; health & disease and water & sanitation. They are developing a new ‘pathways approach’ to understanding and action on sustainability and development, providing new thinking and practical solutions. Their work addresses two vital global challenges: linking environmental sustainability with better livelihoods and health for poor people; and helping science and technology work for poverty reduction and social justice.
