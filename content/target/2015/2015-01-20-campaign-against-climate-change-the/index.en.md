<p>The Campaign against Climate Change (CCC) exists to push for the urgent and radical action in order to prevent the destabilisation of global climate. The CCC seeks to raise awareness about the gravity and urgency of the threat from climate change, brings people together for street demonstrations and aims to push for an international emissions reductions treaty.</p>
