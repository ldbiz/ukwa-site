The estate owned by Mr Robert Brudenell, was occupied and developed by his family since 1514, from a mediaeval manor around a courtyard into a Tudor and Georgian mansion. Today the home and garden are welcome to visitors. The rooms on view are regularly used by the family and their friends and contain a large collection of family portraits, furniture and memorabilia. On the site is The 'Old Kitchen' tearoom, serving light lunches and a selection of cakes and scones.
