<p>The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) supports radical art and culture. Through a programme of exhibitions, films, events, talks and debates, the ICA challenges perceived notions and stimulates debate, experimentation, creativity and exchange with visitors. It was founded in 1946 by a group of artists, collectors and critics including Roland Penrose, Peter Watson and Herbert Read.</p>
