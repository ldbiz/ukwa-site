<p>The British Infection Association was established after the merger of the British Infection Society and the Association of Medical Microbiologists. These organisations have come together to enhance the prevention, management, and control of infection and to improve professional representation on national bodies formulating policy about training, continuing professional development and delivering health care in the field of infection.</p>
