The Liberty Choirs were created by MJ Paranzino, singer, composer and choir director, and her partner, the journalist and writer, Ginny Dougary. Their idea was to take MJ’s singers into prisons to create choirs with inmates in a continuous programme of choir singing. The second part of the programme kicks in when the ex-offenders are ready to be released into the community – they hope is that they would feel comfortable joining the community choirs.
