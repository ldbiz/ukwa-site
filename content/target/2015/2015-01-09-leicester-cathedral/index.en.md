Leicester Cathedral, built on the site of a Roman temple and dedicated to St Martin of Tours, has been embedded in the public, economic, cultural and religious life of this community since medieval times.  Since 1927, as the seat of the Bishop of Leicester, now gathers people together for worship, celebration, lament, debate and service of the poor and vulnerable.  It offers hospitality to the wider church, the communities of faith which make up our multicultural society and those who come as visitors to the East Midlands, especially in search of the story of King Richard III.
