National Records of Scotland (NRS) was established on 1 April 2011, following the merger of the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) and the National Archives of Scotland (NAS). They perform the registration and statistical functions of the Registrar General for Scotland, including responsibility for demographic statistics and census, and the archival functions of the Keeper including maintaining the archives as one of Scotlandâ€™s five National Collections, and providing a leadership role for Scottish archive and record professionals. They are responsible for the service for family history provided under the ScotlandsPeople brand.
