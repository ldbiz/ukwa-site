The British Empire at War Research Group is a forum for scholars interested in all aspects of the British Empire’s war history, particularly the Empire’s participation in world wars. Convened by Professor Ashley Jackson (King’s College London) and Dr Yasmin Khan (University of Oxford), it organises regular academic events and publishes online essays and occasional research papers.
