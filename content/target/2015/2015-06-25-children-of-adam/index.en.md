The Children of Adam is a group of volunteers who get together once a week to distribute food, drink and clothes to homeless people and people living in difficult circumstances in London. We meet every Sunday at 6pm at Lincolnâ€™s Inn Field (and you are welcome to join us) where we hand out any items needed by the 100 or so homeless people we meet each week.
