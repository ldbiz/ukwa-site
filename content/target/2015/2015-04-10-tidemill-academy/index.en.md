Tidemill Academy is a successful, innovative and happy community school in Deptford, South East London. We are a two-form entry school with a Speech and Language Resource Base which serves children from both Tidemill and other Lewisham schools. With the inclusion of our Nursery, we have the capacity for approximately 480 children. We have over 40 languages spoken in the school and our children come from a rich variety of backgrounds. Our pupils are well behaved, eager to learn and are supported by a team of talented and dedicated staff.

With a wonderful new school building and state of the art facilities we are well positioned to equip our pupils with the skills, knowledge and experiences to be successful, responsible citizens in the 21st century.
