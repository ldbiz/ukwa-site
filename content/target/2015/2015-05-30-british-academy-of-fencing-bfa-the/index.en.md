The British Academy of Fencing (BFA) provides a training system that is focused on the sword in hand acquisition of the skills of a fencing coach. They support and encourage coaches and Masters in the continual development of their own skills and the modernisation of the sport and provide a technical foundation from which a coach can then choose to develop as a club, school, leisure or performance coach.
