Stanhope is a culturally rich and ethnically diverse community school with high expectations.  They are very keen for the children to learn to be the very best that they can be so that they care about learning and the wider community.  At Stanhope they are continuously looking for innovative ways to work with parents and the wider community to improve their school and their children's future life chances. The school takes boys and girls between the ages of 3 and 11.  There are 21 classes with 3 classes in each year group from reception to year 6.  There is also a nursery class offering 25 places in the morning and 25 places in the afternoon.  Children attend either all morning or all afternoon sessions. The website is full of helpful information about the school and they look forward to working in partnership with their families to ensure that together our pupils are responsible individuals who care about learning and their wider community.Nominated by a Smashfest 2015 visitor, who commented:i check the school website to see photos of myself!
