New Start is ‘articulating the alternative’ for places. Writing about a new local economics. Sharing ideas and solutions. New Start was launched as the UK’s first regeneration magazine in February 1999. Since then it has told the stories of the people and projects creating social and economic change in local areas in the UK and internationally. It has been part of Manchester-based Centre for Local Economic Strategies (Cles) since October 2010.
