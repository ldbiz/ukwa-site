Radical Middle Way is a place where young Muslims – in the UK and around the world – connect with their spiritual and cultural identity and explore what it means to believe in the 21st century. By working alongside grassroots partners, we create platforms for open debate, critical thinking and deep spiritual reflection. We provide powerful, faith-inspired guidance that gives our audiences the tools to combat exclusion and violence, and encourage positive civic action. Our work fosters more open, engaged and cohesive communities.
