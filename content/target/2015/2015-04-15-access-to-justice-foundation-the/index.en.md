The Access to Justice Foundation is the result of collaboration between the Bar Council, Chartered Institute of Legal Executives, Law Society and the voluntary sector (represented by Advice Services Alliance), supported by the Judiciary, the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General's Office. The Foundation aims to help in the overall effort to provide practical “access to justice” to those unable to afford help and to encourage the development of further schemes that will raise new, additional, money to support the provision and organisation of pro bono legal assistance.
