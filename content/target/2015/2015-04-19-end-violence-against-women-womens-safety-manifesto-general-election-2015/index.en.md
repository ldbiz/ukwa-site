The End Violence Against Women Coalition is a unique coalition of organisations and individuals campaigning to end all forms of violence against women. They were set up in 2005 when women's organisations and others came together to lobby the government to take a more strategic approach to ending violence against women, including making a commitment to work which aims to prevent violence against women. They lobby all levels of government in the UK, and challenge the wider cultural attitudes that tolerate and condone violence against women. The EVAW Coalition is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity.
