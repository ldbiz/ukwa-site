The Association of Photographers was first formed in 1968 as the Association of Fashion and Advertising Photographers. The Association's aims are to promote and protect the worth and standing of its members, to vigorously defend, educate and lobby for the interests and rights of all photographers, especially in the commercial photographic industry.
