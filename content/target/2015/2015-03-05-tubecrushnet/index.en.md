This is a British website that allows users to submit secretly taken photos of attractive men on the Tube. TubeCrush.net was set up four years ago by a group of friends living in London. "The third biggest source of traffic to our website is actually from China," says Stephen Motion, the site's co-founder. "The website isn't blocked in China. It's fully available in all of the cities. We see most traffic coming from Guangzhou and Shanghai."
