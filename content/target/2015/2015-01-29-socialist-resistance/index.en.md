Socialist Resistance is a group of Marxists, who take the side of the working class, the poor and the oppressed in Britain and internationally. Their political activity has the aim of putting society under the democratic political and economic control of working class people. They run a website, publish books, and organise monthly local meetings and larger national events. In July 2009, they became the British section of the Fourth International, the worldwide socialist organisation.
