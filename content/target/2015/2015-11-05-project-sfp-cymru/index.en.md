SFP10-14 (UK) was a seven week programme for families with young people aged 10-14. The programme helps families with young people to prepare for the teenage years and offers a relaxed and friendly environment where they can all learn and have fun together. Several regions in Wales have been offering the Strengthening Families Programme as part of a research trial.
