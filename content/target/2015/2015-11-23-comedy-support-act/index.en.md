Comedy Support Act is a new charity based in the UK set up by professional comedians for comedians. The charity is funded by benefit shows and it aims to provide emergency funds and assistance to professional comedians who find themselves in financial hardship through serious illness or accident, as well as providing information and links to other professional and relevant organisations.
