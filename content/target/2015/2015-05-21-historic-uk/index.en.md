Historic UK's vision was to bring history to life it consists of two sections. The first section of the website is called the Historic Accommodation Guide, a collection of castle hotels, historic holiday cottages and characterful hotels designed to stir the imagination and allow history lovers to stay in some of the most historic buildings in the country. The second section of the website was the History Magazine, a monthly online publication featuring all of those weird, gruesome and interesting bits of history that were often left out of the school curriculum.
