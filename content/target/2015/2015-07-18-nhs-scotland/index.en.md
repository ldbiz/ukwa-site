NHS Scotland employs approximately 140,000 staff who work across 14 regional NHS Boards, seven Special NHS Boards and one public health body. Each NHS Board is accountable to Scottish Ministers, supported by the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates. Regional NHS Boards are responsible for the protection and the improvement of their populationâ€™s health and for the delivery of frontline healthcare services. Special NHS Boards support the regional NHS Boards by providing a range of important specialist and national services.
