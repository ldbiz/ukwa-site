The British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES) is the professional body for sport and exercise sciences in the UK. It promotes excellence in sport and exercise sciences. The application of scientific principles to sport and exercise is principally achieved through one of the three branches of science or through interdisciplinary approaches (biomechanics, physiology and psychology).
