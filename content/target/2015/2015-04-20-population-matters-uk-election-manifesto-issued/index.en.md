Population Matters is a membership charity that addresses population size and its effect on environmental sustainability. They see population growth as a major contributor to environmental degradation, resource depletion and other problems. To address these, they conduct research, inform the public and advocate improved family planning, better sex education and womenâ€™s empowerment, which together yield smaller and thus more sustainable families.
