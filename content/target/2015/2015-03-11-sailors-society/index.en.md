Founded in 1818, the Sailors’ Society is a not-for-profit Christian Society although it remains independent. It is present at many of the key ports around the globe where it maintains a staff of professional Chaplains who are experienced in multi-faith and cross-cultural work. The Sailors’ Society provides a wide spectrum of support services – chaplaincy, spiritual guidance and counsel, provision of welfare support to seafarers and their families, assistance with continuing maritime education and financial help.
