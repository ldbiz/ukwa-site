Tobias School of Art & Therapy is an independent charity offering courses in Arts for Health and Wellbeing and Arts in Therapy .The programme’s focus is on deepening the student’s proficiency in engaging with processes through art and the human encounter for healing, personal growth and social change. The shared orientation of the programme at Tobias is the developmental philosophy founded by Rudolf Steiner, known as Anthroposophy, a modern spiritual path that respects the freedom of each individual, through a holistic understanding of body, soul and spirit. Students are invited to explore this approach in order to come to their own judgements about its validity and relevance. This is taught within a critical context including Psychodynamic and Humanistic theory and practice.
