The International Association of Maritime Institutions (IAMI) is an association of colleges and other organisations providing education and training for personnel involved in the Merchant Navy, Towing and Fishing Industries, though its Members and Associate Members also serve the wider maritime industry and the offshore industry. It is based in the UK and was founded in 1993 as a result of the amalgamation of the International Association of Navigation Schools and the Association of Marine Engineering Schools which themselves date back to 1917 and 1952 respectively.
