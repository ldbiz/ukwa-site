The association's aim is to remember and preserve the story of the children, the ni√±os vascos, who in 1937, during the Spanish civil war, were evacuated from Bilbao in the Basque region of Spain. Initially accommodated in a large camp at North Stoneham, Eastleigh, they were eventually dispersed to many 'colonies' throughout the country.
