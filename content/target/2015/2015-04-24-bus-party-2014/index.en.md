This site details the work of the Bus Party who were a group of artists who toured Scotland in the Referendum, asking, “What kind of Scotland do you want?”. Through music and song, poetry, plays and readings, they opened up conversations with sixteen local communities in eight days, listening to their hopes for the kind of Scotland they want, however they would vote on 18th September 2014.
