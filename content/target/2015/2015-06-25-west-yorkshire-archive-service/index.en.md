The West Yorkshire Archive Service exists to preserve the local heritage of historical documents and to help members of the public make use of them. The Service has offices in Wakefield, Bradford, Calderdale (Halifax), Kirklees (Huddersfield), and Leeds. WYAS collects and preserves historical records of all kinds dating from the twelfth century to the present day. More information about the kinds of archives they keep can be found in our online catalogue or in our collections guides. WYAS offers a wide range of services including using archives in our searchrooms, our Research Service, The West Riding Registry of Deeds, learning and community support, and conservation and preservation advice. They also offer a modern records storage service and advice to local authorities on record keeping.
