Having established communities in Nantes and Brussels, the first foundation in the UK was in London in 1873.  Since then, Helpers have worked where the needs were greatest and according to the gifts of the Sisters, in the inner cities and surrounding area of London, Portsmouth, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
