This is the Welsh language render of openstreetmap. It's a test site and a map of Wales in the Welsh language. This has been possible due to openstreetmap sharing data (unlike other maps providers), due to the volunteers that contribute, and due to government funding for 
Open Data Institute (@ODIHQ) community node for Cardiff and the Satori Lab.
