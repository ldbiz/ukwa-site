BrExpats is an innovative sociological study that questions what Brexit means for Britons resident in other European Union member states. Through the research the team aims to raise awareness of the diversity of British citizens living in the EU27 and their lived experiences of Brexit. Working closely with Britons living across the EU27, it keeps a finger on the pulse of how they experience Brexit and its impacts on their lives as it unfolds.
