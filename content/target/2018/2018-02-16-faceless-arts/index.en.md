Faceless Arts is a collective of professional artists and producers, working nationally and internationally at the leading edge of creative community engagement often in the outdoors and with communities less well served. We bring art and people together by creating exceptional arts experiences which invigorate and enthuse people to develop confident and proud communities everywhere.
