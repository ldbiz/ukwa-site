The Foreign Policy Centre (FPC) is a British think tank specialising in foreign policy. It was founded in 1998 by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his colleagues. It was launched, at an event with then Prime Minister Tony Blair, with the aim of developing a "vision of a fair and rule-based world order". It is pro-European Union.
