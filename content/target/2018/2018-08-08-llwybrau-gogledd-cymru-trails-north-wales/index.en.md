This is an app by Tourism Partnership North Wales, now part of Visit Wales, that provides details of six circular walks in north Wales. The app draws together interesting information, maps and images. For instance, one walk focuses on Celtic legends; another guides walkers to a hidden waterfall; a third entices visitors with the intriguing name the ‘Giant Slayer Walk’.
