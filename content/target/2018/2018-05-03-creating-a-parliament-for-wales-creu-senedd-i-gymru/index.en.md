The Wales Act 2017 gives the Assembly powers over its own electoral and internal arrangements. The 'Creating a Parliament for Wales' is an attempt to engage the public and to hear their views on the Expert Panelâ€™s recommendations and other potential changes to the Assembly such as who can vote, the size of the Assembly and the electoral system.
