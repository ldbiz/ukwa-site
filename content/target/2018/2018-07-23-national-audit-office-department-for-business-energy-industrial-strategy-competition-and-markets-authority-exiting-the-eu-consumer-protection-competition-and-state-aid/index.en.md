The legal and regulatory frameworks covering consumer protection, competition and state aid are intended to create fair and effective markets that support consumer confidence and economic growth, and ensure that competition and markets work well for consumers. Consumer protection law helps protect consumers from unfair trading practices, competition law aims to promote competition between firms to the benefit of consumers and businesses, and state aid regulations are intended to prevent distortions of trade and competition. These three frameworks are linked to varying degrees with European Union (EU) law and sit within the competency of the European Commission (EC). In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is responsible for the general framework of consumer protection, and has overall policy responsibility for completion and state aid.  The UK government has indicated that the UK will leave the EU single market when it ceases to be a member of the EU. Following EU Exit, the competencies in all three regulatory areas will fall exclusively to the UK, which will have implications for the UK government and regulators. BEIS will need to ensure that the UKâ€™s legal and regulatory frameworks are operable from March 2019 in the event of no deal, or at the end of a transition period if this is agreed. UK authorities will need to develop increased capacity, and new skills and capabilities, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and UK regulators will need to prepare for the relationship with European regulators and other agencies to change.
