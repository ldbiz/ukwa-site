Graphic Medicine is a site that explores the interaction between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare. We are a community of academics, health carers, authors, artists, and fans of comics and medicine. The site was established by Ian Williams , a physician, comics artist and writer and is supported by the Wellcome Trust.
