St Thomas Way is a new heritage route from Swansea to Hereford, inspired by a real medieval pilgrimage. In 1290, a group of pilgrims set off from Swansea for the shrine of St Thomas at Hereford Cathedral. Among them was William Cragh, a Welsh outlaw, walking barefoot, wearing a rope noose around his neck. The St Thomas Way is funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, and is based at the University of Southampton, in partnership with Hereford Cathedral.
