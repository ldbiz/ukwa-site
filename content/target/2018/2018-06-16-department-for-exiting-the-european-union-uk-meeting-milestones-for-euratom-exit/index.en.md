The Nuclear Safeguards Bill became one of the first pieces of legislation addressing the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union to complete its passage through Parliament. The Bill addresses the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), an international organisation that governs the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the EU. This essential legislation enables the government to establish a domestic nuclear safeguards regime following departure from Euratom and provides a clear signal to the public, industry and international partners that the UK is on track to meet its obligations from day one of exit.
