Blog of Jonathan Bryan, a previously 'locked in' child aged 11 at the start of 2018. Includes Jonathan's 'Teach us too' campaign. "Given the predictions we were given for Jonathan shortly after his traumatic birth, based on an MRI scan of global brain damage, it is nothing short of a miracle that he is now spelling everything he wants to say using his eyes on an alphabet board. We have had a rich variety of experiences with Jonathan in the last 11 years, but this last year, since he has begun spelling, has been the most extra-ordinary. In this blog we want to share some of the story of how Jonathan went from choosing between a few objects and spelling in one and a half years, and also to give you a chance to hear the voice of a 10-year-old who was effectively locked in for 9 years."
