Cleve Hill Solar Park Ltd (a joint venture by Hive Energy and Wirsol Energy) is proposing to develop a solar park on the north Kent coast at Graveney, near Faversham.  Cleve Hill Solar Park proposes to generate renewable power through photovoltaic panels up to 4m high, providing clean power to UK homes.  If approved, it will be the UK's largest solar park development, covering an area of c.1000 acres – equal to more than 420 football pitches – of grazing farmland and wetland alongside Faversham Creek and the Saxon Shore Way.  The area includes a SSSI and is an important habitat for migrating birds.
