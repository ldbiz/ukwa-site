At Backstage Tales, our goal is to show what happens behind the scenes in fashion, music, film and other creative industries. We launched our online magazine 3 years ago with an aim to give exposure to those who aren’t yet renowned, but truly deserve to be. We celebrate those who work hard behind the scenes, push their creativity to the limit, generate amazing ideas, and business solutions, that shape the creative industries’ end products that we view on a daily basis. Our extensive international team retraces fashion collections, editorials, film productions, music movements, and businesses to their very conception. We believe that from the minds of these gifted creators, there is a story to be told, that will provide you with an insight into how these creative industries operate.
