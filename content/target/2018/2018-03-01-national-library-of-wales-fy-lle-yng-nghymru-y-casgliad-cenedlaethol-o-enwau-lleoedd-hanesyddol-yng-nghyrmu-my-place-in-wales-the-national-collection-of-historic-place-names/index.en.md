The site acts as a hub for a group of related projects concerned with recording and understanding the place-names of Wales and will bring together three sets of data: (1) all the names from the Ordnance Survey 6 inch to a mile maps, collected by the Wales 1900 crowdsourcing project; (2) a database of the earliest forms of all the historic settlement names in Wales, compiled at the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies; (3) the huge archive of place-name forms collected by Professor Melville Richards and held at the University of Bangor.
