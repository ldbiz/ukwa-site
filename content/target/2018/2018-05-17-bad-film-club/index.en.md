Bad Film Club meet monthly at Chapter, Cardiff. The Bad Film Club has created a place where like minded folk can gather to celebrate the guilty joy that is a good bad movie and re-create that living room atmosphere of a night in with friends. The shackles of polite cinema etiquette are discarded. The audience are encouraged to jeer, heckle and participate with the film creating a unique interactive cinema experience.
