GB Short Track are based and train at the National Performance Centre for short track speed skating, located at National Ice Centre in Nottingham since 2000. 

The squad ranges in age from 16 to 30 years-old, with athletes of varying experience. Upon selection for the national squad, athletes relocate to Nottingham to train full-time. The younger skaters that choose to move away from home to be part of the team live with host families in the local area.
