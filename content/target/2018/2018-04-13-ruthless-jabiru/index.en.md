Ruthless Jabiru is a London chamber orchestra dedicated to New music and humanitarian stories. The ensemble is made up entirely of professional Australian musicians based in the UK and conducted by its founding Artistic Director Kelly Lovelady. Programmes are devised around existing and commissioned repertoire by todayâ€™s composers with a view to promoting sustainability and ethical dialogue. The ensemble is held under the official patronage of composer Brett Dean.
