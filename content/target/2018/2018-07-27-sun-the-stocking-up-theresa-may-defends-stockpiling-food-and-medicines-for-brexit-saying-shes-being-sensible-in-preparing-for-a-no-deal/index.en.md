Theresa May defended stockpiling food and medicine for life after Brexit - saying she was being “sensible” in preparation for potentially leaving the EU without a deal. The Prime Minister said she was working round the clock for ‘every eventuality’ and people should not panic – but instead be comforted by that news. She was backed up by her Chancellor Philip Hammond, who agreed it was a "responsible thing for a government to do”.
