Politically our policies are neither left nor right. We have a commitment to a mixed economy and the provision of essential public services. We are implacably opposed to blind acceptance of globalisation economics based on cheap labour and the off-shoring of English jobs. We believe that there is a need to support our own manufacturing industry. We also believe that Charity Begins at Home and would prioritise help for the vulnerable and pensioners in our own country rather than giving away so much of our money to foreign governments and institutions â€“ often ones with well-deserved reputations for financial malpractice.
