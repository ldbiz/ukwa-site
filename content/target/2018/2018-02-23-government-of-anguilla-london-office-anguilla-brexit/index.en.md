Anguilla has direct borders with France and Holland that are both EU member states. Anguilla is heavily dependent on both France and Holland for essential commodities and services that include fuel, international access and basic medical and general services such as MRI scanning, dentistry and post. Each evening at 10pm the French close their border with Anguilla, effectively cutting the islands off.  The EU is Anguillaâ€™s only source of significant developmental aid. The UK regards Anguilla as ineligible for support from DFID, which only provided nominal support even when Anguilla was deemed eligible, and despite having a lower GDP than other recipients of DFID funding.
