Border Engineering Training Association (BETA) is an employer led organisation which, was founded in 1967 by ten local engineering companies interested in providing a training service in the Border's community. The initial involvement was that of skills training for craft and technician apprentices and the development of operator training in the fast growing electronic and printed circuit board manufacturing sectors.
