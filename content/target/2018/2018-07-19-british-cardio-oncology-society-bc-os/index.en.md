The British Cardio-Oncology Society was formed in 2012 by UK cardiologists and oncologists from multiple sub-specialties interested in and working on the cardiovascular effects of cancer treatment. Our mission is to promote research, best clinical practice and a wider understanding of the effects of cancer treatment on the cardiovascular system.
