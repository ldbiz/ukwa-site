The Society of Advocates in Aberdeen exists to promote professional expertise and standards amongst members of the legal profession in and around Aberdeen, to foster rapport amongst them and their standing in the community, and to provide facilities towards those ends. Its history goes back hundreds of years, but it has its feet firmly in the 21st century.
