M Fest presents the UK’s first festival of culture and ideas dedicated to Muslim communities. With more than 25 events running from Friday 27th to Sunday 29th April 2018 at The British Library and P21 Gallery, MFest provides a unique platform in the centre of London for emerging and established writers, performers and artists to present their works and bring together Britain’s incredibly varied Muslim population.
