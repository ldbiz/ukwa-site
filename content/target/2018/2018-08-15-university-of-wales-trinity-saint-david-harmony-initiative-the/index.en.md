The Harmony Initiative is a collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David's Sophia Centre for the Study of Cosmology and Culture, and the Institute of Sustainable Practice, Innovation and Resource Effectiveness (INSPIRE).  Its goal is to take forward the conversation on sustainability and what we as individuals and communities can do to live in harmony with the natural environment. Its aim is to hold public outreach events and to develop related courses at the University.
