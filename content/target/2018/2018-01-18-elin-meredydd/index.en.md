Elin Meredydd's practice has 'primarily been focused on text and performance. [Her] most recent works, predominantly performed in Wales and specifically developed whist undertaking the UNIT(e) residency at G39, have been observations on the ‘art world’ while transitioning from being a student to working independently'.
