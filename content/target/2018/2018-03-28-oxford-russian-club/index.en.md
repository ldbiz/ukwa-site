The Oxford Russian Club or Oxford Russian Society was founded  as a self-governing organisation by Prince Felix Youssoupoff in 1909 - while he was a student at University College - in order to promote links between Russia and the University. Today, the Russian Society numbers over 300 active members from Russia, the post-Soviet states, and fans of Russian culture from all over the world. All events are bilingual.
