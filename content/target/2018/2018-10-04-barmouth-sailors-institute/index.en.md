Barmouth Sailors' Institute is a rare survivor of a type of establishment that was once common in coastal communities throughout the British Isles in the late nineteenth century. Many seamen's institutes came into existence, not just as a meeting place but also where the Lloyds List and Shipping Gazette were available for consultation. From these, the families could trace the lengthy voyages of their husbands and sons. The Institute is open to all members of the public, free of charge, every day between 9am and 6pm.
