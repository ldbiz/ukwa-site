The Juncker Commission stands accused of pursuing a federalist agenda regardless of what citizens want; championing the most divisive and unsupported migration policies of the past 20 years; proposing an increase in spending for the new seven year budget, despite the departure of the UK, one of its biggest net contributors; and the EU’s own ombudsman this week found the Commission guilty of four instances of maladministration in the secretive appointment of Martin Selmayr – Juncker’s former Chief of Staff – as Secretary General.
