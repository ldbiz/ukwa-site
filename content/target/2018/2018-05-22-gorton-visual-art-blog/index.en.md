Gorton Visual Arts has been creating artwork in and around Gorton and Manchester since 2006. By involving elderly residents, vulnerable adults and residents with learning difficulties, in  a safe studio environment  new skills are learnt and shared. Gorton visual arts actively promote social cohesion and inclusion through the arts.
