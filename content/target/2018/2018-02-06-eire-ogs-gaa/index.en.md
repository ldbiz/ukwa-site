Established in 1959, the Oxford branch of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Éire Óg, celebrates over 50 years of playing and promoting Gaelic games in Oxford.

Éire Óg’s formation in Oxford has helped the Irish people who have come to live in this beautiful city settle amongst friends old and new, by retaining an important aspect of their Irish heritage. The club has also introduced the game to new players from a variety of cultural backgrounds.
