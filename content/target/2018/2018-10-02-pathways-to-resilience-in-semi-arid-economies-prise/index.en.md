The PRISE research project is a five-year, multi-country research consortium that works in partnership with policy and decision-makers in semi-arid regions in Africa and Asia to generate new knowledge about how economic development in semi-arid lands can be made more inclusive and climate-resilient. The consortium is led by the Overseas Development Institute in the UK.  The PRISE website hosts research evidence generated by the PRISE research project over the last five years.
