The report argues that the cultural sector urgently needs more clarity on free movement post-Brexit. The Government wishes to "take back control" of the UK's borders by ending the free movement of persons. However, by the time of writing, it had provided little detail about what this would mean in practice. Despite the lack of detail about the Government's plans, the Committee suggests that future immigration from the EU to the UK will be shaped by one of two broad imperatives. The UK immigration system will either give preferential treatment to EU27 citizens, or treat them in the same way as people from third countries. The Committee recommends that the Government be flexible. The UK's negotiators must recognise that any restrictions on EU citizens wishing to enter the UK may be matched by restrictions on UK workers in the EU. A decline in skilled workers from the EU would not only damage the UK's cultural sector, but also represent a significant loss to the audiences that benefit when talented people from across Europe perform in the UK.
