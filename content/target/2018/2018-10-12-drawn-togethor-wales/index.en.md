Drawn Together is Wales' largest drawing community project and invites people in Wales to look at their surroundings, and draw them. People have been recording their vision of Wales onto paper and uploading the images onto the Drawn Together website. These drawings will be on display in the National Museum Wales during October 2018. It is delivered by Coast Lines and Voluntary Arts Wales, and has funding from the Arts Council of Wales, The Ashley Family Foundation, Awards for All & Pembrokeshire County Council.
