The Bapell Chapel in Cwmbwrla, Swansea was demolished in the 1980's and as a result the graveyard has been neglected and overgrown by non-native invasive plants. The Babell Graveyard Project is a plan to re-develop and regenerate the graveyard to allow safe access to the graves and remove an eye-sore from the community.
