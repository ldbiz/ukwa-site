The Imagining Jerusalem network was an AHRC-funded project that ran from 2013-2015. This website was run by the Network Coordinator, Hannah Boast, and is no longer being updated. Any questions should be directed to the Principal Investigator, Dr Helen Smith. The AHRC-funded network Imagining Jerusalem, 1099 to the Present Day brings together scholars and institutions from across Europe to explore the complex global heritage of this city. It asks how Jerusalemâ€™s past has been appropriated in the social and political imagination, and how we might use this knowledge to imagine new futures, both for Jerusalem itself and for the idea of Jerusalem in public life.
