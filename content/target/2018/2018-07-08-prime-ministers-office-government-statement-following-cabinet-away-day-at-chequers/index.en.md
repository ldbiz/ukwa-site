Following a day's discussion at Chequers, the Cabinet agreed its position on the UK's future relationship with the EU. It proposes: 1) Establishment of a "free trade area for goods" to "avoid friction at the border, protect jobs and livelihoods, and ensure both sides meet their commitments to Northern Ireland and Ireland"; 2) The UK and EU to agree to a "common rulebook for all goods including agri-foods", with British ministers committing in a treaty to ongoing harmonisation with Brussels' rules necessary to provide for frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland; Establishment of a joint institutional framework to oversee UK-EU agreements, with the UK agreeing to pay "due regard" to EU case law in areas where the common rulebook applies;  and Establishment of a joint institutional framework to oversee UK-EU agreements, with the UK agreeing to pay "due regard" to EU case law in areas where the common rulebook applies.
