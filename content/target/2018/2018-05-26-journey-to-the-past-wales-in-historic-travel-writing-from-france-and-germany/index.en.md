Journey to the Past is a collaboration between Bangor University, the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies (CAWCS) and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales and is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The original project ‘European Travellers’ collected over 440 travel accounts, the majority of which are written in French and German, and provides detailed descriptions of their content in a searchable database, Accounts of Travel. Following on from this project, Journey to the Past has managed to combine historical sources with new technologies and commissioned the digitisation of material held in the special archives and collections of the Royal Commission.
