Jeremy Hunt called on the EU to change its approach on Brexit, and said the risk of failing to reach a deal had risen in recent weeks. The British foreign secretary was speaking at the start of three-day tour of continental Europe in August 2018 aimed at persuading member states to back Theresa Mayâ€™s Brexit plan.
