There was longstanding concern about the delivery of ambulance services in Wales resulting in a Strategic Review of Welsh Ambulance Services and tasked with making recommendations to enable high quality and sustainable ambulance services for the people of Wales. The Emergency Ambulance Service Committee provides a mechanism to support the recommendations of the 2013 McClelland review of ambulance services. It puts in place a structure which is clear and directly aligned to the delivery of better care.
