Food is a fundamental part of sustainable development. The Manifesto will map closely to the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which makes it a legal requirement for public bodies in Wales to consider the economic, social, environmental and cultural wellbeing of Wales, and act in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. The Food Manifesto is an attempt to identify actions the Welsh Government could take to create a better food system. The work is supported by the Bangor University ESRC Impact Acceleration Account.
