Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has called for a fundamental change in ministers' tone on Brexit, accusing UK negotiators of being "cowed by the EU". The Eurosceptic backbencher said in a speech that "close alignment" with the EU after Brexit would be unacceptable. Chancellor Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has
