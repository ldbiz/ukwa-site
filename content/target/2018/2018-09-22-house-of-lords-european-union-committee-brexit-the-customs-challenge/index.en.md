On 17 January 2017 the Prime Minister, set out the Government’s intention to leave the EU’s Single Market and its customs union. In its Chequers White Paper, published in July 2018, the Government reiterated this commitment and proposed the establishment of a Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) with the EU. This aimed to preserve the status quo for UK-EU trade, while enabling the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. Alongside a free trade area for goods and a ‘common rulebook’, there would be no tariffs and no routine customs controls. The Committee found that the FCA proposal raised a number of significant questions that needed to be resolved, not only for it to be workable, but also acceptable to the EU.
