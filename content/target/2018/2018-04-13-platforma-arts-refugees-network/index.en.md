Platforma arts and refugee network supports and develops arts by, about and with refugees and migrants from marginalised communities.  It brings together groups and artists / performers of any background or political status (e.g. refugees and non-refugees), whose work examines the varied experiences of refugees both before and after they arrived and settled in their host country. We hope that the quality and diversity of the work presented within the Platforma project will encourage new audiences to relate more closely and empathetically to the experiences of refugees. Platforma is managed by Counterpoints Arts in partnership with organisations across the country. Every two years we run the Platforma Festival â€“ the first was held in London (2011) , then Manchester (2013), Leicester (2015), Newcastle, Gateshead, Stockton & Middlesbrough (2017).
