Predicts that Eurocrats will turn the screw tighter, leaving Britain with a choice between no deal and, in effect, non-voting membership. Preparing for no deal ought therefore to be our national priority. By “preparing for no deal”, I don’t just mean buying lorry parks near Dover or making sure that our driving licences will work abroad. I mean making the kind of preparations that will keep Britain flourishing through any disruption: cuts in corporate and personal taxes, removal of regulations, openness to global business. So far, alas, we have been going in the opposite direction. In Brussels, they have noticed.
