This House of Lords Library briefing was prepared in advance of the debate due to take place in the House of Lords on the motion moved by Baroness Thomas of Winchester (Liberal Democrat) on 28 June 2018 “that this House takes note of the different challenges facing disabled people in the United Kingdom in 2018”. It provides an overview of the legal framework governing disabled people’s rights in the UK both in domestic law, in the Equality Act 2010, and in international law, in the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. It also examines some possible implications for disabled people of the UK’s exit from the European Union.
