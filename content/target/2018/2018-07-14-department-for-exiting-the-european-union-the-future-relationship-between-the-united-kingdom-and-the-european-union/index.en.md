The White Paper confirms that the government is opting for a soft Brexit The UK's "common rulebook" plan would be implemented via the UK making a full treaty commitment to remain harmonised with EU law in perpetuity, The institutional framework of the deal would be an 'Association Agreement', as the EU has with Ukraine and Moldova. While UK courts would no longer be able to make direct reference to the European Court of Justice, the dispute resolution mechanism would mean the UK would still be bound by ECJ rulings.
