This is a blog on Cwm Idwal Nature Reserve providing news on wildlife, plants, geology, arts, events from Cwm Idwal. The blog was published from February 2013 until January 2015. Cwm Idwal was designated as a National Nature Reserve in 1954, primarily because of its unique geology and its rare plants that have colonised along the slopes. Cwm Idwal is 5 miles south of Bethesda and about 4 miles west of Capel Curig.
