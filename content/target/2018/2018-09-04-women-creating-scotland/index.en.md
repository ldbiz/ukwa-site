Site of a group of postgraduate students of the Universities of Glasgow, Strathclyde and the Glasgow School of Art aiming to celebrate the women who have helped to shape Scotland through the creative and artistic industries since 1918, when women successfully obtained the right to vote within the UK. By celebrating this historic landmark it is hoped that the event will help to create an overview of the impact which women have had on Scotlandâ€™s rich built environment, internationally renowned cultural and written heritage over the last 100 years.
