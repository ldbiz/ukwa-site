There is no domestic legal or constitutional requirement for a vote to be held in Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement before it is concluded by the UK and the EU under Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU). The Government can negotiate and sign an international treaty using its prerogative powers and without any formal parliamentary involvement. Article 50 TEU requires the consent of the European Parliament for the Withdrawal Agreement to be approved.
