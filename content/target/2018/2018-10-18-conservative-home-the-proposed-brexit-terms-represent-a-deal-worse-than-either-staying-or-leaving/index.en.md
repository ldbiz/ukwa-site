The proposed exit terms (remaining in the customs union) represent a deal worse than either staying or leaving the EU. We need to drop our sunk costs stubbornness and try something different. Any outcome – no deal, Norway, Canada, even the risk of a second referendum – would be better than what is currently on the table. This is our last chance to pull out of the nosedive.
