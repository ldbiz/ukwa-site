Thousands of activists were to take to the streets on Saturday April 14th as part of a national day of action to demonstrate public support for a vote on the final Brexit deal. Remain-backing groups were emboldened by a shift in public support towards staying in the EU, and a number of high-profile figures have come out in favour of a second referendum, including former prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair.
