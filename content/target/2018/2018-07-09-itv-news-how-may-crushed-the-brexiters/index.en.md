Tory MPs and ministers have consistently under-estimated their leader. What Theresa May achieved at Chequers on July 6th 2018 was extraordinary. She persuaded her cabinet to sign up for a Brexit plan that drove a coach and horses through what the Brexiters in her team – especially Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – said Brexit was all about, during that historic referendum campaign. What is more Gove was a cheerleader for a plan that would enshrine in treaty what was supposedly anathema to his Brexit cause – that the UK now and forever would be subject to European Union rules and regulations governing the quality and safety of  manufactured goods and agricultural products
