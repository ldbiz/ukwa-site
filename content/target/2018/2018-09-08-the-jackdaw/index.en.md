The Jackdaw was founded in 2000. Its purpose is to keep interested parties informed and entertained about aspects of art that are in the news. By and large itâ€™s pretty nasty and critical of many things, and especially of the corrupt, self-serving art establishment which stinks like a rotting carcase.
