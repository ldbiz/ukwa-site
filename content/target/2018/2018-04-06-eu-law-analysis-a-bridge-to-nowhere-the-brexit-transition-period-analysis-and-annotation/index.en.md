This blog post presents a detailed annotation and analysis of the agreed rules on the transition period in the withdrawal agreement. It also looks in detail at two other issues: how the specific provisions on the transition period fit into the agreement as a whole; and what happens if the two sides want to extend the transition period, given that it might be difficult to agree all aspects of the UK/EU future relationship by the agreed deadline of end-2020.
