The Association of Circus Proprietors of Great Britain, generally referred to as The ACP, is the leading-edge trade association providing leadership and professional support for the circus industry in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Established in 1932, it has, for over eighty years, promoted the interests of its members and the circus industry at large. It is recognised by Government as the consultative body on proposed legislation or other matters which could affect that industry.
