The concepts enshrined in the draft Animal Welfare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill are important and worthwhile. They deserve better than to be treated in a cavalier fashion yet the impression given to the Committee is one of haste. It appears that this draft Bill has been presented to the public - and Parliament - in a far from finished state. Many of the key concepts in the Bill remain undefined, so limiting the value of pre-legislative scrutiny, while the lack of a formal regulatory impact assessment is a further troubling matter. The absence of such a document further emphasises the impression that this legislation has not been properly thought through before publication.
