Leeway was established in 1974 with the help of a Â£200 start-up grant from Norwich City Council. Over the past four decades the charity has grown from those humble beginnings and we now have six safe houses and a team of more than 50 people providing advice, support and information to any adult or child experiencing domestic abuse in Norfolk and Waveney.
