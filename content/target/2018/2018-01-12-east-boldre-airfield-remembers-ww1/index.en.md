At some time between 2014 and 2018, many towns and villages throughout the United Kingdom will commemorate the centenary of The Great War. East Boldre is no exception. Not only did the village lose twenty-six brave men who are remembered on the villageâ€™s three war memorials, in 1915 the Royal Flying Corps Training School, known as RFC Beaulieu, was built at East Boldre.
