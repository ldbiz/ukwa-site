Johnsey Estates own the former British Nylon Spinners factory in Mamhiland, Pontypool. This is their planning application to Torfaen Council for a contemporary urban village set within an attractive landscaped setting. It will harness the considerable local built and natural environmental resources to create a new highly sustainable community where people will wish to live, work and visit.
