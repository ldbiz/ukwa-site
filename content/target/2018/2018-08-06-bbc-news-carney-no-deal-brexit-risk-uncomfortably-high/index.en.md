Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned in an interview with the BBC that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was "uncomfortably high" and "highly undesirable". The pound declined on the currency markets in the wake of Mr Carney's comments, falling below the $1.30 mark, but had recovered by early afternoon.
