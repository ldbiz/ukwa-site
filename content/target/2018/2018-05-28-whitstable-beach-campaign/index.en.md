The Whitstable Beach Campaign is an organisation that was founded nearly twenty years ago.  Its sole aim is to preserve the unspoilt nature of the beach and protect the right of access to it. We believe that the beach is vital to the community. It is a much-loved open space, which should be protected for all time.
