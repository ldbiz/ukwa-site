The Digital Bridgend aim is to promote heritage interpretation via digital means and will centre around 6 local places of interest, known as ‘digital hubs’. and by developing the content and technical capabilities at each site, they will become exemplars of best practice in contemporary heritage interpretation. The Digital Bridgend project is supported by Bridgend County Borough Council, The Heritage Lottery Fund, Welsh Government and the European Regional Development Fund.
