The aim of Prosiect15 is to provide a platform for successful and inspiring individuals to give 15 minute ‘TED’ style talks through the medium of Welsh. Prosiect15 invited 5 Welsh-speaking individuals from completely different backgrounds to share their experiences in 15 minute talks to challenge, inspire and evoke discussion. The event was held in 2016 in partnership with Arloesi Gwynedd Wledig, BBC Radio Wales and Pontio.
