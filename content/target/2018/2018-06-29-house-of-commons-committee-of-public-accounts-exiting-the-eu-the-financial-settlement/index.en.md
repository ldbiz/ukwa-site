The cost to the UK of leaving remains uncertain because it depends on future events, such as the UK’s economic growth. There is a risk that the amount the UK actually pays will fall outside the narrow range estimated by the Treasury of £35 billion to £39 billion. The Treasury’s estimate does not include at least £10 billion of costs to the government on leaving the European Union associated with the settlement deal, including nearly £3 billion of contributions towards the European Development Fund. It also does not include potentially significant costs associated with the UK’s future relationship with the EU. The taxpayer could continue to make payments for years to come.
