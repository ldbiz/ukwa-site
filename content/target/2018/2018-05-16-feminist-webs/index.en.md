Feminist Webs is a 'women and girls work space' that acts as an archive and a resource for practitioners, volunteers and young women involved in youth and community work with young women. Our bias is toward work which encourages participation and is from a perspective that focuses on womenâ€™s rights and experiences. We pride ourselves on working across the generations in everything we do, and include people in many communities in our work, including people of all races, sexualities, classes, faiths (and of no faith), academics, practitioners, and everyday people who want to see a better world for women.
