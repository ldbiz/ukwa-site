In this letter published on the Treasury website, Mr Hammond repeated the findings of the Treasury's provisional Brexit analysis released earlier in 2018. That analysis includes a warning that a "no-deal" Brexit could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years, compared with the "status quo baseline".
