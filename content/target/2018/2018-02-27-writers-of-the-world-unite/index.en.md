Literary festival, London, Picadilly, April 2017. Writers of the World Unite brings the world to Waterstones Piccadilly. Over four days, weâ€™ll talk Russian revolutionary poetry, debate identity politics in the age of globalisation, discover how Caribbean literature makes its own rules and look at the radical potential of graphic novels.
