A review of specialised services for children and young people was carried out by the Specialised Health Services Commission Wales (SHSCW) now Health Commission Wales (HCW). As a result of this review and the public consultation that followed the future delivery of children and young people's specialist healthcare was agreed for Wales using Managed Clinical Networks (MCNâ€™s). This is the project website, its consultation coming to an end in 2009.
