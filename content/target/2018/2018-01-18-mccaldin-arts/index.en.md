Welcome to McCaldin Arts, a small company that brings together artists to collaborate on staged performances of vocal music. Run by its namesake, the mezzo-soprano Clare McCaldin, McCaldin Arts invites composers, stage directors and artists of other disciplines (including dancers, designers and video artists) to work together on original, versatile works of music theatre.
