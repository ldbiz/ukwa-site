The Crafty Beeress is a blog born out of one woman’s love of beer. It started as a diary to document beers but it’s grown to encompass news, reviews, events, opinion pieces and more (with the occasional Bee Gees reference thrown in). The aim of the blog is to talk about beer in an accessible way; I don’t pretend to be an expert and, while I love to learn about the science of beer, I have no interest in being a brewer.
