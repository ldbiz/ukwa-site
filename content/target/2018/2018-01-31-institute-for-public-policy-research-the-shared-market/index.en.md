This report a plan for a new UK-EU partnership that we believe would meet the UK’s priorities and have the maximal chance of securing an agreement with the EU27. This plan is ambitious, and necessarily so – anything else would not be a suitable starting point for the UK’s negotiating strategy. The proposal recognises the reality that 40 years of membership of the
European Union cannot and should not be undone in the space of two years. It prioritises regulatory alignment but allows for an orderly divergence over time,
if that is judged to be in the UK’s interests.
