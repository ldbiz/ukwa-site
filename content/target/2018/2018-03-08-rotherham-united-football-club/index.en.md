Rotherham United Football Club, nicknamed The Millers, is a professional association football club based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. Founded in 1925 as a merger between Rotherham Town (1899) and Rotherham County (1870), the club's colours were initially yellow and black, but later evolved into the more traditional red and white.
