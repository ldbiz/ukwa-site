‘Conwy and the Great War’ is a Menter Iaith Conwy project largely funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and explores the various ways in which the rural area of Conwy county was affected by the First World War. The sites looks at stories of individuals to the effect on the Welsh language and the parishes’ social dynamics, as well as attempting to provide an insight as to what kinds of communities they were in terms of culture and outlook a century ago.
