Women4Resources was established in 2006 and is a small organisation working with women and girls in partnership between Wales and Africa. They provide support, practical assistance or funds to initiatives that are designed, run and managed by women which are intended to have a long term impact on poverty. Women4Resources promote and raise awareness of equality and diversity.
