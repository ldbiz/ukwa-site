The Cardiff Rugby Digital Archive went live in 2018 and is a collection of memories, mementoes, reminiscences and records. Archive will contain a record of rugby memorabilia owned by Cardiff RFC and Cardiff Blues, a summary of results and reports from each season from 1876, and copies of programmes from famous and lesser-known matches.
