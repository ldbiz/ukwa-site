The University of Oxford offers a breadth of academic analysis and expert commentary as Britain’s new relationship with the European Union and wider world takes shape. Faculty members across our academic divisions – Social Sciences, Humanities, Medical Sciences and Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences – discuss the national and global implications, help explain the key processes, pose the most pressing questions, and address significant challenges and opportunities.
