The British Retail Consortium has written to UK Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Unionâ€™s Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier to highlight the potential for damaging consequences for millions of UK consumers and tens of thousands of EU-based producers if an agreement in the Brexit negotiations is not reached that protects the free flow of goods between the EU and UK from 29 March 2019.
