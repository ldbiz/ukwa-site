The Chamber is well connected to the various bilateral organisations that deal with Egypt and the UK â€“ both in government and the private sector. It further has close ties with the network of regional Chambers of Commerce across the UK.

We help our members grow their business via bespoke advice and a series of events, workshops and regular targeted trade missions to Egypt, as well as market visits for Egyptian companies to the UK.
