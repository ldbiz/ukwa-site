The British Science Association, which showcases the best of British science, is pleased to announce that the British Science Festival. The event is one of Europe’s longest-established science festivals, which each year travels to a new part of the UK, bringing a vast array of events, performances and exhibitions with a scientific twist.

Working in partnership with the University of Hull and other organisations in the Humber region, the British Science Festival will be a flagship event as part of Hull’s City of Culture legacy focusing on three key areas – energy and the environment; health and the medical sciences; and exploration, movement and discovery.
