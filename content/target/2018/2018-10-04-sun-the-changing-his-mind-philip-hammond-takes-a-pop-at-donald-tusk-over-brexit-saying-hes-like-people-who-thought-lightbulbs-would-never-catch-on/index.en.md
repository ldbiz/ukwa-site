In his speech at the 2018 Tory Party conference, Philip Hammond hit out at the EU for trying to block Theresa May’s Brexit plan - saying Eurocrats were behaving like the people who tried to stop the rise of electricity. The Chancellor also predicted Britain would see an economic boom once we cut a trade deal with Brussels, dubbing it a “deal dividend”.
