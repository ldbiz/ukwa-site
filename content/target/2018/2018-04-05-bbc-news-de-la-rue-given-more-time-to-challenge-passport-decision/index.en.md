On April 3rd 2018, the government granted a two-week extension in the process to decide who would make UK passports after Brexit. British company De La Rue - which had lost the Â£490m contract to French-Dutch Gemalto in March - had requested the longer "standstill period", which was agreed by the Home Office.
