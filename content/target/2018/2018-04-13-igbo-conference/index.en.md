The Igbo Conference, In partnership with The Centre for African studies, SOAS, University of London is a forum for  discovering the Igbo culture, language and heritage.

The annual Igbo conference aims to promote the study of Igbo language and culture within the UK, and seeks to bring academics and members of the Igbo community together for the purpose of knowledge sharing and exchange. The ultimate goal of the Igbo conference organisers is to eventually establish an Igbo Centre in London which will act as a hub for anyone interested in research in the field of Igbo Studies (through a library, archives and study space), as well as providing a resource for members of the public to learn more about Igbo culture (through artifacts and interactive resources).
