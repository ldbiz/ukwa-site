An assessment by Dover Council expressed concern over how ports would cope with a "no deal" Brexit. The Dover council report stated: "A 13-mile stretch of the coast-bound section of the M20, between junction eight near Maidstone and junction nine near Ashford, will be earmarked to hold heavy goods vehicles, in what will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park holding around 2,000 lorries." The council feared there would be no permanent solution for years.
