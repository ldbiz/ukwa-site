Luton Irish Forum (LIF) is a registered charity and limited company formed in 1997, with over 900 members and a centre close to Luton Town Centre. Whilst originally set up to safeguard the needs of the Irish residents in Luton, LIF is now a representative community organisation serving Lutonâ€™s diverse vulnerable and socially excluded people.
