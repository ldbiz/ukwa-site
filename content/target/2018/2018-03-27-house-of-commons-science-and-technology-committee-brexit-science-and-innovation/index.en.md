The Committee calls for an early deal for science and research with the EU – to be in place by October 2018 or earlier if possible. The report argues that negotiating a deal on science is a ‘win-win’ for the UK and the EU, and so getting an early agreement could set a positive tone for other elements of the negotiations.
