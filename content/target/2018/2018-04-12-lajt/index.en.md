Lifestyle magazine reaching Polish speakers in the UK. We know what is trending, what is hot and it is worth reading! We started in 2006 as Panorama Magazine. In 2015 Panorama changed to a modern lifestyle magazine covering health, beauty, trends, gossips and parenting topics. In July 2016 we made a step forward and changed once again. Let's welcome a new LAJT Magazine!
