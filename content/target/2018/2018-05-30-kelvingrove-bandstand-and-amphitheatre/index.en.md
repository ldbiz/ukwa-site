The website of Kelvingrove Bandstand and Amphitheatre. The Bandstand was built in 1924 and is the only original bandstand left in Glasgow. It closed in 1999 and fell into disrepair. In 2012 a redevelopment plan was agreed through a partnership between Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, Glasgow City Council (buildingâ€™s owner) and Glasgow Life (end user) and it opened in time for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
