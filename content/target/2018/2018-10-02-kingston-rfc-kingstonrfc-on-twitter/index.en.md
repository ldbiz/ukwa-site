The official Twitter account of Kingston Rugby Club. Founded in 1887, Kingston rugby club is based on the Hook Road, about one mile from Surbiton. The club has excellent facilities within its two-storey clubhouse, which was built to the RFU specification, including a large bar on the first floor overlooking the pitches, a weights room, physio room and excellent changing facilities. 

The club has qualified coaches across all age ranges and is looking to become a rugby centre for excellence in the borough of Kingston.
