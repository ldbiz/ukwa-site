Alawon Cymru is a website by CLERA (The Society for the Traditional Instruments of Wales) and provides an alphabetical list of Welsh folk tunes and a listing of events. The Wales Arts Council supported Clera, the society for Welsh traditional instruments in its cross-Wales initiative, Alawon Cymru to help musicians learn and play Welsh traditional tunes and to improve the standard of their playing. The funding has now come to an end but Clera is still supporting Tune Clubs across Wales.
