Ledbury Amateur Dramatic Society (LADS ), a member of The Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, is a registered Charity (no. 1174743), and was formed in 1938.

For over 40 years, LADS produced plays in the old Market Theatre, shown to the left, which was built as a temporary church hall on the same site in 1910.
