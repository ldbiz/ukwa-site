Archaeological Perspectives Analysis Consultancy (A.P.A.C. Ltd) was originally established in 2004 to promote the use of electronic topographical field survey. Its use proved to be of great advantage during archaeological research work on earthwork castles in the South Wales area, leading to important discoveries and a reassessment of early castle studies. This expertise and service is now available to the public and private.
