Personal website of Kate Cooper - a prize-winning historian who writes about women and family, daily life, and religion in the ancient world.  Kate’s most recent book, Band of Angels: The Forgotten World of Early Christian Women, shows how women and story-telling – the stories women told and the stories told about women – were central to the ‘viral’ spread of early Christianity. Kate Cooper often blogs on topics regarding Late Antiquity, angels, women, and the Church.
