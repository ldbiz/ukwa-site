It has been predicted that Brexit issues will give rise to many legal actions in UK and other Member States' courts, and the Court of Justice of the EU. While there have not yet been a great many, several cases have been brought by UK citizens living in other EU Member States, while other cases have been interesting for their implications for the UK's future relations with the EU. This paper looks at issues that have been the subject of legal action in UK and EU courts.
