Theresa May is reported to have drawn up plans for a secret charm offensive aimed at persuading dozens of Labour MPs to back her Brexit deal even if it cost Jeremy Corbyn the chance to be prime minister. Senior Conservatives said they had already been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs over a period of several months, making the case that the national interest in avoiding a no-deal outcome was more important than forcing a general election by defeating the government on May’s Brexit deal. They were convinced they would need Labour votes to win, after a fractious Tory conference in Birmingham, at which determined opponents of the prime minister’s approach, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, won plaudits for saying they would vote against it.
