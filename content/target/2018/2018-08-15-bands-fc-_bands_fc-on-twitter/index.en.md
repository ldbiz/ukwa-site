Bands FC combine soccer club crests with popular music group logos giving you a blend of both entities. The Twitter account was set up in June 2018, it was created by Tim Burgess from The Charlatans, Mark Liptrott of Concrete Studio and Nick Fraser, who sells merchandise for the Charlatans. There will be a series of exhibitions to display these crest and logo mashups in the USA and the UK starting in autumn 2018.
