Spirit Of Shankly (SOS) is an unofficial supporters union for fans of Liverpool F.C.. Named after former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, although the union was formed in early 2008 by disgruntled fans opposed to the former Liverpool F.C. ownership of Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr., it quickly developed into a cooperative representing its members (and by implication other Liverpool F.C. supporters) on a whole range of issues such as ticketing, travel and community and regeneration issues. Its ultimate aim is to seek fan ownership of LFC in the long term.
