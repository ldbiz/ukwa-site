Site of a trust whose award celebrates play schemes in Scotland that follow the ethos of Nancy Ovens, educator, who recognised that play is integral to children's lives and that children should be involved in designing their own play - projects, therefore, that get children and young people involved in making choices about their play; develop their skills through play; enable them to experience challenge in their play and supports them to make judgements about risk.
