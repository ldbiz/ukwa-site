Since October 2017, the European Commission has tabled four separate proposals for a substantial overhaul of the way the EU’s VAT system has operated, in one form or another, since 1992. In this Report, the committee discusses these four proposals in turn. They relate to the treatment of cross-border sales of goods; the flexibility of individual EU countries to vary their domestic VAT rates; special schemes for small businesses to ease the burden of collecting VAT; and cooperation between the Union’s national tax authorities to combat fraud. It has also focused on the implications of Brexit for the UK’s domestic VAT regime, and the consequences for UK-EU trade.
