The Equiano Centre is based in UCL's Department of Geography.


This unique initiative has been established to create a focus for academic and community scholars and research students of all levels to come together and debate emerging and new ideas, theories and  research methods around subjects such as Black History in Britain, and theories of race, racism and anti-racism.
