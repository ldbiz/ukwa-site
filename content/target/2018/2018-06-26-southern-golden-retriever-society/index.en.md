The Southern Golden Retriever Society was founded in 1977 and covers the areas of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and London, south of the River Thames. It is one of 13 breed clubs dedicated to the safeguard and perpetuation of the Breed. The Society strives always to achieve the ideal of a true dual purpose dog.
