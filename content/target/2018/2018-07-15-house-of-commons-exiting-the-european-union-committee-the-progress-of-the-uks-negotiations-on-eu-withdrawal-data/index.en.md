As the UK leaves the EU, it will also leave the legal framework for moving data between the UK and the EU. The UK needs to act to ensure data flows can continue uninterrupted between the UK and the EU, for the benefit of businesses and consumers. The Committee's report says that to ensure data flows between the EU and the UK can be maintained after 29 March 2019, the UK Government should start the process to secure a Data Adequacy Decision from the EU as soon as possible.
