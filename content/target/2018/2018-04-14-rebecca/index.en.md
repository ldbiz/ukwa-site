Rebecca began publishing in April 2010 and considers itself to be Britainâ€™s first stand-alone investigative website and takes its name from the Rebecca Riots, a series of agrarian disturbances in west Wales in the nineteenth century. Rebecca covers the whole of the UK but has an emphasis on issues concerning Wales. The editor of Rebecca is the northern Irish-born journalist Paddy French who was a current affairs producer on the ITV Wales programme Wales This Week.
