EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has criticised Theresa May's proposals for a customs arrangement. This temporary "backstop" is meant to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by kicking in if alternative customs. arrangements can't be negotiated and implemented in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020. The EU's version would see Northern Ireland stay in the EU customs union, meaning a customs border in the Irish Sea. The prime minister proposed an alternative which would see the whole of the UK match EU tariffs.
