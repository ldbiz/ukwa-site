The Save Llandaff Meadow group  is an environmental pressure group made up of local residents in the Llandaff area of Cardiff. Cardiff Metropolitan University is seeking to drain and level it for a football pitch and possibly a sports complex. The Save Llandaff Meadow group was formed in order to oppose this development.
