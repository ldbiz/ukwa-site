FISP, or Foundation for Information Society Policy. A think tank that is entirely independent of political parties, communications & network providers and any other commercial interests in technologies, products and services.

FISP exists to formulate inputs for policy and regulatory development with the over-riding objective of encouraging maturity in the digitalised economy – our ‘Information Society’.
