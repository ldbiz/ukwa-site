Surrey Wildlife Trust is one of 47 Wildlife Trusts working across the UK. With the invaluable support of volunteers and members we manage over 8000ha of land for wildlife and people in Surrey. We also work with other organisations and landowners to protect and connect wildlife sites across the county and inspire local communities and young people to care for wildlife where they live.
