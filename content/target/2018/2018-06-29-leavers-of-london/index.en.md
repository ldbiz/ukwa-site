Leavers of London is a monthly meetup group where like-minded people who voted Leave in the EU referendum - left and right leaning, can come together to:share personal experiences from voting Leave; represent the Leave vote in London in a positive light; reform the perception of Leave voters and build a positive case for the UKâ€™s future outside of the EU; and discuss and implement ideas for how the UK can use the referendum result to build a more equal and inclusive society
