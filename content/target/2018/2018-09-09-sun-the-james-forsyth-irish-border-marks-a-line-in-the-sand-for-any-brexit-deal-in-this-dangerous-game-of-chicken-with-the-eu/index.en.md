The EU and UK are engaged in a very dangerous game of chicken over the h border. There has been almost no progress on this issue and without an ­agreement on it, there can’t be a deal. One of those involved in the negotiations on the British side tells me the EU “believes we will blink first”. But the British won’t do that. One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.
