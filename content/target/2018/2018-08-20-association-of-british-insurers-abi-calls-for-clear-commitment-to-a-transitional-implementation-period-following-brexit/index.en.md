The ABI sets out 'five key asks' for UK insurers: securing an appropriate regulatory environment; retaining the ability to passport out of and into the UK; closely mirroring the EU data protection regime; an improved future migration policy that enables the employment of high-skilled professionals from both within and outside the EU; a strong focus on regulatory dialogue and interantional agreements on financial services markets.
