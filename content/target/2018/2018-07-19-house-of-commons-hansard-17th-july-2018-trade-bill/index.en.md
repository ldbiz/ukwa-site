The Government got the Trade Bill through its final Commons stages on July 17th 2018 - seeing off an attempt that could have forced the UK to seek a customs union with the EU, but not before one government defeat. The defeat came on an amendment tabled by former minister Phillip Lee seeking to make it a negotiating objective for the Government to secure UK participation in the European medicines regulatory network partnership. But the crunch vote came on the amendment from another former Tory minister, Stephen Hammond, which sought UK participation in a customs union with the EU if an agreement on a frictionless trade area for goods isn't reached by 21st January 2019. The amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 301, thanks to four Labour leavers voting with the government.
