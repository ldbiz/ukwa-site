The Prime Minister said that the draft text of the Withdrawal Agreement put forward by the European Commission was unacceptable to the UK as it would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and constitutional integrity of the UK. The PM reiterated that both she and the Taoiseach had said that their priority was to resolve the border question through the overall relationship between the UK and the EU.
