No 10 had prepared a proposal for a "Temporary Customs Arrangement", where the UK would retain close ties to the EU for an indeterminate period after the end of the transition period - past 2020 - in case none of their hoped for customs fixes came to pass.

So the brakes were slammed on publishing the paper until meetings and discussions between senior ministers tomorrow.
