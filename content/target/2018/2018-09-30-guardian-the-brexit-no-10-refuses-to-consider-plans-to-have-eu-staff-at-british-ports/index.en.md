Downing Street refused to consider proposals to have EU officials stationed at British ports serving Ireland, intended as part of a solution to the problem of the Irish border after Brexit. The compromise plan, which was under consideration by Ireland and Brussels, was aimed at “de-dramatising” the Irish border issue, and reflected the fact that many goods entered Northern Ireland via Dublin, and not Belfast or the two other main ports in the region.
