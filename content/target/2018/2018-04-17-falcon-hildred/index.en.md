Falcon Hildred produces watercolour drawings, which record the buildings, structures and landscapes of 19th century industry. He was born in Grimsby and now lives in north Wales. Since the late 1950s, he has pursued a unique personal project to make a visual record of the buildings of a disappearing industrial culture.
