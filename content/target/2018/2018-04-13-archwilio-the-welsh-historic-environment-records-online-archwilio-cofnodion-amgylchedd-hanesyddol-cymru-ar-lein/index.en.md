Archwilio provides public access to the historic environment records (HERs) for each local authority area in Wales and developed in association with the Welsh Archaeological Trusts (Clwyd-Powys, Dyfed, Glamorgan-Gwent, Gwynedd). It includes information on tens of thousands of historic sites or investigative work across Wales.
