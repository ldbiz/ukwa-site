"LabourList is an independent progressive blog providing a platform for open debate about centre-left issues and the future of the Labour movement.
Although we are a broad umbrella organisation seeking to draw together the many views and factions of the progressive spectrum, we also believe that progressive ends – such as a robust and resolute welfare state, social and educational equality and a fully funded National Health Service, free to all at the point of delivery – can only ultimately be achieved through the continued electoral success of the Labour Party."
