Howe concludes that under the proposal we would be headed for "a worst-of-all-worlds 'Black Hole' Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EUâ€™s legal and regulatory tar-pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU Member State". While he believes that these proposal will not be accepted by the EU "since in their perception they amount to unacceptable 'cherry picking' of the 'benefits' of the single market", he fears that Brussels will keep the UK negotiating for so long that when time runs down, the EU will then demand "huge last minute concessions in return for not taking away the transition period".
