When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the Government has said that it will end the direct jurisdiction in the UK of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). On the assumption that this happens, it is essential for the rule of law in the UK that an adequate replacement is found, both to help resolve any disputes between the UK and EU post-Brexit, and to ensure that there is a robust system that will allow individuals and businesses to enforce their rights.
