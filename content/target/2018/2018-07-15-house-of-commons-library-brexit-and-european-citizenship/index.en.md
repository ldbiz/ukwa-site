When the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 UK nationals will lose their right to EU citizenship. Although the draft withdrawal agreement contains provisions that will guarantee certain citizens' rights for UK citizens living in another EU Member State and for EU citizens living in the UK, they will not guarantee EU citizenship status. There have been proposals for a form of 'associate' EU citizenship, which does not at present exist and is not being discussed by the Brexit negotiators. This paper looks at the debate and at public support for such proposals.
