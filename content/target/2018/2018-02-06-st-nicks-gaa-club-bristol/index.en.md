Welcome to the official website of St Nick’s GAA Club Bristol. St Nick’s are a Bristol Based Gaelic Football club that provides for Bristol and surrounding areas such as Bath, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Swindon, Weston Super-mare, Exeter, Tauntan, Newport, Cardiff and further into Wales. Our location just off the M4 offers easy access to training and matches and we can also arrange pick up from Bristol Temple Mead’s or Patchway for players looking to travel by train to Bristol. A lot of our players live around Bristol city centre so pick up anywhere from the centre is possible.
