A petition calling for the need to secular, fact-based sex education after it came to light that three of the four accused in the high profile rape trial in April 2018, went to a school that uses the christian fundamentalist organisation Love for Life as their provider of sex education. The petition was set up ROSA Northern Ireland, ROSA is a socialist feminist movement and stands for Reproductive rights, against Oppression, Sexism & Austerity.
