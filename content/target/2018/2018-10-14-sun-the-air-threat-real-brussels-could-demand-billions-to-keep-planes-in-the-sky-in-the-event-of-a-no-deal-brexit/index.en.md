The EU could hold Britain to ransom by demanding billions to keep planes in the sky in the event of a bitter No Deal, according to the Head of the National Audit Office. He told the Exiting the EU Select Committee that if the UK got “tough” by withholding the entire £39 billion divorce bill, Brussels could seek revenge by refusing to sign “mutual” agreements to keep airlines in the sky.
