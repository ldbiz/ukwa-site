'A Bird in a Cage' is a Heritage Lottery funded project that engages young people with their political heritage. The website focuses on Margaret Mackworth, better known as Lady Rhondda, an important women’s rights campaigner throughout the first half of the 20th century and imprisoned for attempting to blow up a postbox in Newport for the cause of women’s suffrage. Schools across Caerphilly and Newport are exploring the life and work of Lady Rhondda and participating in history, music, creative writing and animation workshops, in order to create their own animated film.
