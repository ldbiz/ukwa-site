The blog is written by Ann Shaw (nee Rumsey), an ex-patient at Craig-y-nos from 1950-54 and author of the book "The Children of Craig-y-nos", tracing forty years of lost history of this childrens sanatorium in the Swansea Valley. The blog provides many stories of the hospital by ex-patients and ex-staff. The blog was updated from 2006 until 2017.
