Out of the Blue is a production created especially for babies aged 6-18 months and is co-produced by Theatr Iolo and director Sarah Argent. They have tied up with the Kolkata-based ThinkArts and conducted workshops with Indian practitioners looking to create new work aimed at Early Years audiences. This is one of the initiatives under the more expansive UK India Year of Culture which has showcased cultural events, exhibitions and activities throughout 2017.
