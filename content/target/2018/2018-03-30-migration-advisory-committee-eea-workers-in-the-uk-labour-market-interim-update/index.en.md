In July 2017, the Home Secretary commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to assess the impact on the UK labour market of the UK’s exit from the EU and how the UK’s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy. This is to provide the evidence base for UK migration after the implementation period in 2021. The MAC’s interim update sets out a summary of the views expressed by employers and of the regional issues raised. These themes seemed the best way of summarising the views expressed but should not be taken to imply that the MAC endorses a sectoral and/or regional approach to post-Brexit migration policy.
