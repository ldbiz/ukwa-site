HSCB (Hoe Street Central Bank) is open in the former Co-Op Bank on Hoe Street in the London suburb of Walthamstow as a hub of citizen money creation. Open between 5th -25th June 2018 we're focusing on the big money with some special editions of 100 and 1000.

Between 12th - 25th March 2018 a crack team of locally recruited people of all ages and backgrounds worked with artist Hilary Powell, printmaker Spike Gascoigne and designer Phil Seddon to print Â£50,000 worth of Bank Job currency in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 in just fourteen days.
