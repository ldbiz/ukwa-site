After the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017 over 10,000 objects  were left by members of the public in spontaneous memorials that sprang up in St. Annâ€™s Square and other sites in the city. This website provides an account of how those objects have been cared for and plans for the future to create a public-facing digital archive. The project is a collaboration between the Manchester Art Gallery, Archives+ and the University of Manchester.
