Brexit negotiations failed to reach an agreement over the weekend of 13th/14th October 2018  because the EU was seeking a "backstop to the backstop". Such an outcome would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market but the rest of the UK would not be, introducing a border between the two, something Theresa May would have to reject. The EU was not persuaded that the UK's backstop plan - which put the UK three-quarters inside the customs union, unable to set tariffs but able to negotiate trade deals - would actually work, leading to calls for Northern Ireland to be included in the "backstop to the backstop".
