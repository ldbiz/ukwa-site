Museums and Digital Memory was also designed to align with Museum Futures, the British Museumâ€™s latest Skills for the Future training programme, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. In partnership with over 20 museums across the UK, this five-year programme will invest in a new generation of diverse museum professionals to equip them with a dynamic understanding of digital data management, preservation and access practices relating to museum collections.
