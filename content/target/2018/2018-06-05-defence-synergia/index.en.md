Defence Synergia (DS) is an independent self funding 'British Defence and Strategy Think Tank' and was formed by several former directors and policy board members of the United Kingdom National Defence Association (UKNDA) prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). They research and investigate UK strategy and defence policy and engage with Government and defence analysts on an apolitical, not-for-profit, tri-service basis.
