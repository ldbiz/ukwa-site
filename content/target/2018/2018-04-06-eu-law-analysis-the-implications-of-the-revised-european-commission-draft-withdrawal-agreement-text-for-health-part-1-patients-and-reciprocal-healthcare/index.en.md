Continued access to the EHIC scheme is something that both Jeremy Hunt and David Davis have said that the UK would seek to negotiate. Indeed, Jeremy Hunt described it as ‘perfectly possible’ in January 2017; and Davis said in Parliament that it had been ‘agreed’ in August 2017. Presumably it could be negotiated as part of the future EU-UK relationship(s), and that would cover people not within the scope of the Withdrawal Agreement (for instance, because they are yet to be born). However, it would be better if it were included in the Withdrawal Agreement too.
