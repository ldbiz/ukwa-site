Low-skilled migration would fall when the UK ended EU free movement access after Brexit, Theresa May promised at the 2018 Conservative Party conference. The prime minister said high-skilled workers would be prioritised with no preferential treatment for people from the EU compared with those from the rest of the world. But she said a future trade deal with the EU could include an agreement on "mobility" of each other's workers.
