To coincide with the Year of Legends, promoted by Visit Wales in 2017, S4C will include a collection of programmes that combine ancient and contemporary legends. The S4C's Chwedlau season of programmes contains over 50 stories collected, from all corners of Wales, from all walks of life.  On this site you can watch all of those stories, make your own playlists, find your favourites to share on social media, and continue that legendâ€™s journey into the future.
