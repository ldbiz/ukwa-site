History Acts is a new organisation that aims to develop links between historians and activists. History Acts draws inspiration from the importance of history to organised labour, the womenâ€™s movement, the peace movement, queer activism, environmental activism and land reform, and the various struggles of minorities and workers for equal rights and social justice.  It is being developed in conjunction with the Raphael Samuel History Centre.
