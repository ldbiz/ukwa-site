Yorkshire Emeralds was founded in 2010 by a small dedicated group of hurlers who were keen to play the game in Leeds. Leeds hurling clubs have been thin on the ground in recent years and we're sure there's not been a hurling club in Leeds in recent memory to cater to the needs of the many Irish people who would have played at home before moving here.
