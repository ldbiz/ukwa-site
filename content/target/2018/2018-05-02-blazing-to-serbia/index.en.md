Blazing to Serbia was established to assist and support the Serbian Fire Services with vehicles and equipment, but is now also working with the Serbia Red Cross, two dog rescue centres, the Ruma Rotary Club and various schools in both Wales & Serbia. In 2012, members of the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Young Firefighters and friends drove 6 fire engines across Europe to Ruma Fire Station in Serbia, a distance of over 1400 miles.
