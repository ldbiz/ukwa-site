The Ireland Institute for Historical and Cultural Studies actively seeks to promote republican ideas and thinking and to develop a republican critique of the world. Republicanism embraces a broad range of principles and approaches, the most important of which are democracy, citizenship and internationalism; liberty, equality and fraternity; and self-determination and the common good.
