Since 1996, with encouragement from the Vatican, we at CaFE have been producing a wide variety of modern and attractive DVD resources for Catholics.
A growing number of Anglican parishes are also successfully using CaFE.

We now run a range of missions, retreats and events from around the UK, and our CaFE resources are also available in many other English-speaking countries.
CaFE helps people of all ages in a relaxed, welcoming 'caf√©' style atmosphere to learn, share and pray together.
