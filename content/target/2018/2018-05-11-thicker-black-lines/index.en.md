Thick/er Black Lines is an interdisciplinary research-led initiative applying contemporary art theory, cultural studies and social practices to rewrite histories and to negotiate a way forward. Using print, typography and design our intention is to artistically and intellectually testify to a transnational and a Black European diaspora.  In August 2017 Tate Exchange, Thick/er Black Lines presented ‘We Apologise For The Delay To Your Journey’ a graphic illustration identifying and connecting Black British women/femme artists and cultural workers.
