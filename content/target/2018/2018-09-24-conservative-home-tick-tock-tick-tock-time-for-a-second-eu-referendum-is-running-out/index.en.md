Labour had the opportunity to execute a risky manoeuvre at its 2018 conference.  It could pledge to seek a referendum in the event of No Deal â€“ on No Deal or Staying In.  It would propose both to honour the due date of Brexit and to push for such a referendum if No Deal happened, knowing full well that the timetable made this combination almost impossible. It would not commit to a referendum on any deal the Government struck, but would gamble on voting such a deal down in the Commons and forcing a general election.
