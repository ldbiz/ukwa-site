The National Youth Wind Orchestra of Great Britain (NYWO) the UKâ€™s premier wind orchestra for approximately 75 young musicians aged 14 to 21. Established as a charity in 1986 by Stephen Dodgson, Eric McGavin, Robert Montgomery and Leonard Salzedo, NYWO brings together some of the finest young woodwind, brass and percussion players in the country. The orchestral configuration uses the whole range of clarinets to take the place of violins and violas in a symphony orchestra, resulting in a wonderfully rich and sonorous sound.
