Parts of the UK that backed a Leave vote would face the heaviest hit as a result of Brexit, according to estimates by government officials. The forecasts, seen by MPs, modeled the 15-year impact of the UK staying in the single market, doing a trade deal with the EU or leaving without a deal. They suggested that in England, the North East and West Midlands would see the biggest slowdown in growth. The government said the document did not represent its policy.
