"Barmouth - Viaduct Access Group was established to promote the idea of
building a safe access from Barmouth, to the Viaduct across the
Mawddach. The 700-yard Barmouth Bridge is the longest viaduct in Wales
and carries the Cambrian Coast line from Machynlleth to Pwllheli across
the River Mawddach."
