Theresa May faced a frantic 48 hours to try to save her Brexit negotiating strategy after she admitted talks had ground to a halt because of the EUâ€™s insistence upon a Northern Ireland-only backstop.  The prime minister was expected to plead with EU leaders to drop their Irish backstop proposal at a make-or-break summit dinner on Wednesday October 17th 2018 after seeking the support of members of her cabinet on the Tuesday morning.
