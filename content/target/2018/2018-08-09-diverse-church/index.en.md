Diverse Church is a membership-based Christian LGBT+ organisation. The website includes a blog.  "We believe growth in the christian faith happens most effectively in small scale, peer led christian community.

Because of this Diverse Church plants one self governing LGBT+ Christian community of at least 100 members each year."
