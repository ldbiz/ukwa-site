The Equality Impact Assemssments (EIA) in Wales Practice Hub is a collective source for information and practices from organisations throughout the UK and provides the public sector with resources promoting and supporting the development of good quality, robust EIAs that meet the legal duties of the Equality Act 2010 and the Welsh Public Sector Equality Duties 2011. The EIA Practice Hub will help make EIA an integral part of public practice, and promote equality and fair policy throughout Wales.
