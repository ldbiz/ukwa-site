Centre for Research in Social Sciences and Humanities is a private research institution registered in Leeds, United Kingdom. We are organising academic conferences in wider fields of cultural studies, and setting up an international journal (Journal of Culture and Religion). We will soon start with organising workshops in academic writing, writing CVs, writing motivation letters for employment, and job application writing. The goal of the Centre is to be a place of dissemination for all academics, independent researchers, activists and practitioners, regardless of their origin, methodological/theoretical approaches and academic status/education. While we do lean towards qualitative methodologies and postmodernist epistemology, in a true spirit of respecting ALL knowledge as relevant, we welcome all researchers and all contributions.
