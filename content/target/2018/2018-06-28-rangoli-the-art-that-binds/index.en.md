Rangoli: the art that binds is a multimedia participatory arts project for women and girls in Wales and India. The project is about friendship: between women and girls, art and culture, and India and Wales. During the project, artists and animators from Wales and India will explore the relationship between Rangoli folk art and women's friendships, and introduce and celebrate the practice of Rangoli making with women and girls in Wales. It is part of India Wales, a joint initiative between Wales Arts International and the British Council that supports artistic collaboration and exchange between creative professionals and arts organisations in Wales and India and celebration of the UK India Year of Culture 2017.
