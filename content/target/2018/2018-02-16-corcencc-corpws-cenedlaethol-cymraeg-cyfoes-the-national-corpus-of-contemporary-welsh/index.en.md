The CorCenCC project (Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes â€“ the National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh), is creating a major language resource for Welsh speakers, Welsh learners, Welsh language researchers, and indeed anyone who is interested in the Welsh language. CorCenCC is an inter-disciplinary and multi-institutional project funded by the ESRC and AHRC and led by Dawn Knight, at the Centre for Language and Communication Research, Cardiff University.
