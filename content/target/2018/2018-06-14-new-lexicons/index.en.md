This is the website of editor and author, Gary Budden. "I write fiction and creative non-fiction about the intersections of British sub-culture, landscape, psychogeography, hidden history, nature, horror, weird fiction and more. A lot of it falls under the banner 'landscape punk'. My work has appeared in numerous magazines and journals."
