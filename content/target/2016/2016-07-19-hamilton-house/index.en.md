Hamilton House was a vacant and neglected office block for many years. In 2008 the owners, Connolly and Callaghan invited a group of friends to create a centre for the community. Ever since, Coexist has been working to create a space in which the community can grow, share, collaborate, and learn what it is to live in coexistence with each other.
