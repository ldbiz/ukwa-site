Tower Colliery was located near the villages of Hirwaun and Rhigos, north of Aberdare in the Cynon Valley. For every tonne of coal that is sold from the opencast mining at Tower Colliery, 44 pence is being put into the Tower Fund and then spent in the communities of Hirwaun, Rhigos, Penderyn and Penywaun.
