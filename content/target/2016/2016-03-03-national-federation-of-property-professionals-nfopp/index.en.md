NFOPP aim to promote the highest standards of professionalism and integrity among those working within the property industry, and to encourage members of the public to proactively seek out our members when involved in any kind of property transaction.

The Organisation has a sister company which is the awarding body for its own property related qualifications and is regulated by Ofqual, the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, for a number of its examinations and diplomas.
