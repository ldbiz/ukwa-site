The Microsystems Acupuncture Regulatory Working Group (MAcRWG) is a collaboration of the key professional associations and teaching institutions within the UK involved in many different microsystem acupuncture modalities. Since early 2007 this Group has been working together, as part of The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health regulation programme, to put in place robust systems for voluntary regulation by 2010. In 2016 the funding from the Prince's Foundation expired and the organisation as well as the website shut down.
