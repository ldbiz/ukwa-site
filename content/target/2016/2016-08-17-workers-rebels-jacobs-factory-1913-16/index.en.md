This is the website of an exhibition arranged by the Library Services of Dublin Institute of Technology to remember the connection that exists between Jacobâ€™s factory, an important strategic position for the Volunteers in the 1916 Easter Rising, and DIT Aungier Street which now occupies part of the footprint that was the factory.
