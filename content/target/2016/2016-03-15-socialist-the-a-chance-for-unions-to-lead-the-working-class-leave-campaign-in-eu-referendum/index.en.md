 Despite past support from trade unions of a 'social Europe', they have often opposed the reality of EU policies and not all of them have a formal position on the EU referendum. With Unison announcing a branch consultation on the issue, and other unions likely to follow suit, there is still a chance for the unions to put themselves at the head of a working class leave campaign. If the unions did so, it could transform the situation in Britain.
