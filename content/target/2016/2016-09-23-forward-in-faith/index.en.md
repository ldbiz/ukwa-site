Forward in Faith was founded in November 1992, following the General Synodâ€™s approval of the legislation permitting the ordination of women to the priesthood. Its first National Assembly, which adopted a constitution for the organization, was held in 1994. Forward in Faith is the membership organization which supports and finances the work of The Society under the patronage of S. Wilfrid and S. Hilda.
