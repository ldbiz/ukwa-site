This is the website of a one-year Arts and Humanities Research Council project investigating the impact of festivals, led by Professor George McKay at the University of East Anglia and in collaboration with the London Jazz Festival. The website hosts a history of festivals timeline and will host a report for AHRC on cultural value and impact of festival, the starting activity for which will be a literature review. The second project output will be a critical history of the London Jazz Festival. This will draw on archive materials, interviews, and jazz journalism. The website's blog will contain much of the preliminary data for the book, including transcribed interviews.
