Moseley Record Fair was started by music enthusiasts who have lived and worked in and around this most unique area of Birmingham for many years. Initially, it came into being to partly fill the void left by the many closures of music retailers across the region. Its aim is also to provide a friendly and welcoming space where the good folk of Birmingham, as well as enthusiasts from further afield can come together and browse, buy and discuss the fascinating world of ‘popular’ music.
