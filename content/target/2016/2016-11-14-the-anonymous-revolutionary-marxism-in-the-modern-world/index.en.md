Blog written by Max Edwards, a revolutionary Marxist who died aged 16 in March 2016. The Anonymous Revolutionary began in the winter of 2014/15 as a political blog centred on the theme of Marxism. Its intention was this: to discuss revolutionary socialism in todayâ€™s climate, over two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when capitalism more or less dominates worldwide.
