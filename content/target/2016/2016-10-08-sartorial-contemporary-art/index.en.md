Sartorial Contemporary Art was founded in 2005 by Greta Sarfaty Marchant, artist and curator, as a project-led space. Originally based in an 18th century Georgian house on Kensington Church Street, Sartorial Contemporary Art moved to Kings Cross in October 2008 where it has built a reputation for embracing newly emerging artists.
