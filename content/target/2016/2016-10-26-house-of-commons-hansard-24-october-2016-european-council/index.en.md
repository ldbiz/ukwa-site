Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement on her first European Council. She warns that Brexit negotiations will be difficult and will require some give and take. She believes that if we approach this in a constructive spirit, we can ensure a smooth departure. We can build a powerful new relationship that works both for the UK and for the countries of the EU, and we can secure the deal that is right for the British people.
