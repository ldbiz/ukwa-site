With up to five months to go before the start of formal negotiations on Brexit, Ipsos MORI’s new Political Monitor shows a public divided in their priorities for Britain’s future relationship with Europe after it leaves. Forty-five percent think Britain should prioritise access to the European Single Market while 39% say it should prioritise controlling immigration.
