The movement to create a museum celebrating the women of London’s east end was a reaction to the opening of a Jack the Ripper Museum on Cable Street. The Museum’s owner, Mark Palmer-Edgecumbe had suggested in planning applications that his venue would be a space to explore the lives of women in the area. Violent protests broke out in front of the Museum when in opened in August 2015, and the East End Women’s Museum organisation was established to make the women’s museum a reality.
