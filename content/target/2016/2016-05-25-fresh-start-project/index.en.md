The Fresh Start Project will work with MPs across party lines, along with leading 'think tanks', interest groups, Lords, MEPs and constitutional experts to: examine the options for a new UK-EU relationship; set out what this new relationship could look like;  establish a process for achieving change; and build political support to make it happen.
