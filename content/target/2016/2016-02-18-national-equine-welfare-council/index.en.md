Since its inception in 1977, as a forum for likeminded equine charities to share ideas and welfare concerns, the National Equine Welfare Council C.I.C. has become a nationally recognised and respected member body which unifies the sector on matters of welfare concern.
It is the NEWCâ€™s mission to protect the welfare of the horse, pony, donkey and mule by ensuring that everyone who has an interest or association with the horse makes its health and welfare the overriding factor in all decision making.
