The Affenpinscher breed originated in Germany and was introduced into Britain in 1975. Pronounced 'Affen - pincher' meaning Monkey Dog. The Club's main objectives are no different to those of the majority of breed clubs, promoting the breeding of pedigree affenpinschers, maintaining breed type and advancing the interests of the breed for future generations of Affenpinscher enthusiasts.
