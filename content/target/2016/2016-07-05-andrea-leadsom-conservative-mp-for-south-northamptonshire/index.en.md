Andrea Leadsom was elected as Conservative MP for South Northamptonshire in 2010 and re-elected in 2015 and 2017. She campaigned strongly for the UK to leave the EU during the referendum period of 2016. She stood for the leadership of the Conservative Party after the resignation of David Cameron as Prime Minister and was one of the final two candidates chosen by Conservative MPs, but decided to withdraw from the leadership election.
