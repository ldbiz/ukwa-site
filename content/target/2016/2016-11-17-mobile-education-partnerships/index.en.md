Mobile (formerly Burma) Education Partnerships was built from scratch by practising teachers. They are dedicated to providing high quality professional support based on teacher partnerships bringing together the best of East and West. Since 2008, Mobile Education Partnerships has sent small groups of qualified UK teachers to work alongside teachers in their classrooms in the migrant schools around Mae Sot and in the Karen refugee camps. They now have local teachers and trainers working with us, taking on responsibilities for development, and ensuring sustainability.
