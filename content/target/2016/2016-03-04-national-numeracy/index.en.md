National Numeracy is an independent charity established in 2012 to help raise low levels of numeracy among both adults and children and to promote the importance of everyday maths skills. They aim to challenge negative attitudes, influence public policy and promote effective approaches to improving numeracy. Where possible, they work in partnership with other organisations to achieve these aims.
