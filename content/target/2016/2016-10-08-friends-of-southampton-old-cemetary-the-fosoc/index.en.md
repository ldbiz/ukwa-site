FoSOC was founded in 2003, and has two major aims: to uphold the original purpose of the Cemetery, which is to be a place of reflection and remembrance of the people buried there; to support the ecological aims of the adjoining Southampton Common (a Site of Special Scientific Interest), and to treat it with the same care.
