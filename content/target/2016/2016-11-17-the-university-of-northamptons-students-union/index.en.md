University of Northampton Students’ Union is a registered charity completely independent from the University. Led by students, backed by volunteers and staff, they seek to ensure that time at the University is the best it can possibly be – that it is rewarding, fulfilling and memorable.
All students automatically become members of the Students’ Union- a vibrant community of 15000 - as soon as they enrol and it’s absolutely free. As a member they are entitled to all of their services and opportunities, including sports, societies, volunteering, advice and representation, retail outlets and nightclub.
