Turner Contemporary is an art gallery situated on Margate seafront, on the same site where Turner stayed when visiting the town. The gallery presents a rolling programme of temporary exhibitions, events and learning opportunities linking historic and contemporary art. The organisation was founded in 2001 to contextualise, celebrate, and build on the artist JMW Turnerâ€™s association with Margate, Kent. In 2011, Turner Contemporary gallery, designed by Sir David Chipperfield, opened.
