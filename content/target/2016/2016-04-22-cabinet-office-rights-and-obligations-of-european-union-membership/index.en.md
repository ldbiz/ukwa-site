This paper is the second and final part of the report that the Government is publishing to meet the requirement of section 7(1) of the European Union Referendum Act 2015. The first part, ‘Alternatives to membership: possible models for the United Kingdom outside the European Union’, was made available on 2 March 2016. This paper aims to set out the main rights and obligations arising from the UK’s membership of the EU. It is not exhaustive and does not seek to cover every right and obligation arising under EU law. Instead, it aims to provide a balanced overview of the most important rights and obligations.
