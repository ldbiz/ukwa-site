Brandalism is a revolt against corporate control of the visual realm.  Drawing inspiration from historical anti-advertising movements, Brandalism was founded in July 2012 in England by a small team with a van.  Over subsequent interventions, Brandalism has spread across ten UK cities and most recently to Paris for the UN climate talks.  Armed with high-vis jackets, 'H60' allen keys and creative artworks, these networks are skilled up in reclaiming outdoor advertising space.
