This analysis suggests that, at one end of the spectrum, an exit from the EU hat puts the UK outside the European Economic Area (EEA), but otherwise delivers passporting and equivalence and allows access to the Single Market in terms similar to those that UK-based firms currently have, will cause some disruption to the current delivery model, but only a modest reduction in UK-based activity. It is estimated that revenues from EU-related activity would decline by ~£2BN (~2% of total international and wholesale business), that  -4,000 jobs could be at risk, and that tax revenues would fall by less than £0.5BN per annum. At the other end of the spectrum, in a scenario that sees the UK move to a third country4 status with the EU without any regulatory equivalence, the impact could be more significant. Severe restrictions
could be placed on the EU-related business that can be transacted by UK-based firms. In this lowest access scenario, where the UK’s relationship with the EU rests largely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligations, 40-50% of EU-related activity (approximately £18-20BN in revenue) and up to an estimated 31-35,000 jobs could be at risk, along with approximately £3-5BN of tax revenues per annum.
