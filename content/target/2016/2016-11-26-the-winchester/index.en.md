Urbex blog featuring a range of derelict buildings and urban spaces. "Although my interests stem from dereliction and infrastructure, I am also interested in architecture, urban planning/change and alternative usage for urban space.

Alternative lifestyles, squatting, mental health, urban art/grafitti, The politics of space, society and propaganda also interest me and can tie in with the dominant activities on this site."
