Our project is to erect 2 self-guide direction boards to the 37 WW1 Graves in the 9 acre St Peter's Churchyard, Broadstairs, Kent. We propose to erect the first direction board alongside the St Peter's Footpath which is part of the Turner and Dickens Walk from Margate to Broadstairs and passes close to the area where half of the WW1 Graves are situated. The second board will be beside the central path through the Churchyard which is used by numerous visitors of all ages and local dogwalkers and is close to where the other half of the WW1 Graves are to be found. An accompanying booklet is planned which will contain information about each WW1 Grave with the aim of encouraging the reader to make a return visit and/or to participate in an established ,award winning guided War Grave Tour. In anticipation of increased interest in the guided tour, costs will be incurred in training and equipping new guides. We also plan to place display boards in the Church entrance.
