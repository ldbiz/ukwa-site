WORLDwrite is a UK based charity with a remit to provide educational projects and programmes which promote international understanding. For WORLDwrite this means recognising that our peers globally are not different from ourselves and should equally enjoy a great life. Hence we campaign for freedom from toil and the struggle to survive, to allow us all the opportunity to learn at the highest level, to exercise our creativity, advance new knowledge and impact upon society.
