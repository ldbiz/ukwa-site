Transition Town Initiatives aim to to support and encourage local action on peak oil, climate change and community resilience. They are concerned about our dependency on finite fossil fuels, concerned about how climate change is and will continue to affect our lives and concerned about the ability of their communities to cope with these challenges. Transition Durham was initiated in 2007.
