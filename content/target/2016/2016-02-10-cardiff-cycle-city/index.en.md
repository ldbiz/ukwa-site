Cardiff Cycle City was established in 2014 in order to campaign for a comprehensive cycling system in Cardiff, by building on the existing network and making the most of the Welsh Governmentâ€™s world-first legislation, the Active Travel Act 2013, which aims to improve cycling routes throughout Wales.
