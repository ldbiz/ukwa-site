European Union students applying for university places in the 2017 to 2018 academic year will still have access to student funding support. The move will help give universities and colleges certainty over future funding, while assuring prospective students applying to study at one of the UKâ€™s world leading universities that they will not have the terms of their funding changed if the UK leaves the EU during their studies. The same assurance will be available for EU students studying in further education.
