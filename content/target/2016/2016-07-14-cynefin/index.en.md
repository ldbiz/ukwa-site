Cynefin is run by Severn Wye Energy Agency and helps different parts of the community find creative solutions to improving the places where they live. Cynefin finished in March 2016. According to the site 'The project brought together different parts of a community - local residents, community groups, local businesses, youth groups and organisations that deliver services - to help to improve the places where they live or work, making it cleaner, safer and generally nicer to live in as well as helping to provide more opportunities for business and for people to work and improve their incomes'.
