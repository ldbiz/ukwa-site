The International Health Coordination Centre (IHCC) was established in 2012 and 'provides a focal point for health related international work across the NHS in Wales where previously there was no overall coordination of international health engagement within the Welsh health community. Therefore, the aim is to maximise the potential gains for Wales and its partners, reducing financial, human and political resources which could be wasted in the duplication of efforts. By having a coordinated approach, there is the possibility for new opportunities to arise, including the strengthening of applications for funding'.
