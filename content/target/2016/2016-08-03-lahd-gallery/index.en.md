Lahd Gallery was founded in 2005 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Representing emerging and semi-established artists, we bring together the leading contemporary art works from the MENASA region (Middle East, North Africa and South Asia). Originally set up as a focal point for women artists from the Gulf, the gallery soon became a well known exhibition space on the contemporary art scene. In 2010 the gallery moved to London and has over the last ten years become the foremost gallery promoting exclusively contemporary MENASA art.
