JCA Group is an executive search and succession planning firm, based in London but working with international clients and candidates to find employees for high-end roles in FTSE-listed companies. It was one of five search firms responsible for helping to draft the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms in Board Appointments in 2011 - this document was intended to address the issue of gender diversity on corporate boards.
