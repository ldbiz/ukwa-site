‘Jeanne de Montbaston’ is the alter ego of Lucy Allen, a medievalist working on the literature and culture of late-medieval England. Allen is a teaching associate of the English Faculty at the University of Cambridge. Her research looks at gendered stereotypes of truthfulness in popular fiction, especially medieval romance.
