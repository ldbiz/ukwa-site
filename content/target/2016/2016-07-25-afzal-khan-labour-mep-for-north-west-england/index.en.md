Afzal Khan was selected in February 2013 on the Labour Party's list for North West England at the European Parliamentary election of 2014 and, on 22 May 2014, he was returned as MEP to the European Parliament to represent North West England. In March 2017 he applied to be Labour's candidate in the Manchester Gorton by-election, 2017,[ and was officially selected on 22 March. The by-election was cancelled, however, following the decision for an early general election on 8 June 2017 in which Khan won, becoming Manchester's first Muslim MP.
