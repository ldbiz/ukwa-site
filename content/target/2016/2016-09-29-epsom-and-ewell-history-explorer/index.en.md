The Epsom and Ewell History Explorer was set up and is run by volunteers from the Epsom and Ewell Local and Family History Centre. This site brings together articles covering the local history of the area. The articles may have been inspired by many things including specific suggestions, memories, printed works and of course the internet. The authors try to ensure that the information is accurate, although this cannot be guaranteed.
