The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MND Association) is a British charity, operating in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, established in 1979 by a group of volunteers to coordinate care, support, and research for people affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is a form of motor neuron disease (MND).
