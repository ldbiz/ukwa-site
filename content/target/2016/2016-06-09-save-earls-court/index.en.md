The Earl’s Court Area Action Group was formed to bring together the different interest groups who are affected by the proposed redevelopment of the Earl’s Court Exhibition Centre to form an action group to lobby the Mayor, Boris Johnson, and request that the planning decisions made by both the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea are called in by Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.
