Unseen are working towards a world without slavery. They concentrate efforts on three main areas - supporting, equipping and influencing. Specialist care is the first step in the fight against slavery. Through supporting survivors, their provision gives them a safe place to recover from trauma and rebuild their lives. Their practices are researched thoroughly, enabling us to identify the key issues surrounding slavery and exploitation.They also recognise the importance of influencing the systems that keep slavery hidden, tackling issues such as supply and demand. They work in partnership with communities, business, governments and other organisations.
