Since quitting his job as The Guardian newspaper's Rock Critic in 2000, Tom Cox has written eight books, including the Sunday Times top ten bestseller The Good, The Bad And The Furry, and the brand new follow-up Close Encounters Of The Furred Kind. His account of his year as Britain's most inept golf professional, Bring Me The Head Of Sergio Garcia, was longlisted for the William Hill Sports Book Of The Year Award, and he is currently working on the follow-up. Tom lives in Devon and writes about nature, folklore and the countryside. He writes a monthly diary for Devon Life Magazine and hosts a fortnightly radio show on the experimental rural radio station Soundart.
