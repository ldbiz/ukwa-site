Jim Nicholson stood as Ulster Unionist candidate for Northern Ireland at the 1989 European Parliament election and was elected to serve as MEP. He was subsequently re-elected in 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. Nicholson describes himself as a "euro-realist"; he is opposed to the creation of a federal Europe and is against the adoption of the euro as the currency of the United Kingdom.[2] He does, however, believe that the European Union has been good for Northern Ireland in relation to funding and infrastructure
