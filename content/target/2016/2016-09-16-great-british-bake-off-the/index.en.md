The Great British Bake Off is a baking themed reality show. In this show amateur baking fans compete to be crowned the UKâ€™s Best Amateur Baker. Over the course of 10 hour-long episodes, the series follows the trials and tribulations of the competitors. Each week the bakers tackle a different baking skill, which become progressively more difficult as the competition unfolds.
