Inside every prison, immigration removal centre and some short term holding facilities at airports, there is an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) â€“ a group of ordinary members of the public. IMB members are independent, unpaid and work an average of 2-3 days per month. Their role is to monitor the day-to-day life in their local prison or removal centre and ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained
