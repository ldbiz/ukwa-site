Steven Woolfe stood as a UKIP candidate for the North West at the 2014 European Parliament election and was elected to serve as an MEP.  Woolfe was considered a frontrunner in UKIP's 2016 leadership election, but was excluded from the race after submitting his nomination late.  After Diane James resigned from the party leadership, Woolfe was standing in the second UKIP leadership election of 2016, but withdrew from the contest and the party after he was allegedly injured by a fellow MEP. Woolfe subsequently resigned from UKIP in October 2016, describing the party as "ungovernable".
