The Home Secretary (Interior Minister) of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, gave a speech within the UK EU referendum campaign on the 25 April 2016. She talked about the United Kingdom and its place in the world and its membership of the European Union. She stated that it was her 'analysis of the rights and wrongs, the opportunities and risks, of our membership of the EU'. She concluded that it was 'clearly in our national interest to remain a member of the European Union'. However, she also argued that 'the case for remaining a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights - which means Britain is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights - is not clear'.
