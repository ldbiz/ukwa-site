Influx Press is an independent publisher committed to publishing innovative and challenging fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction from across the UK and beyond. Since 2012 it has published 13 titles, ranging from award-nominated debuts and site-specific anthologies to squatting memoirs and radical poetry.  Founded by Gary Budden and Kit Caless, it publishes stories from the margins of culture, specific geographical spaces and sites of resistance that remain under explored in mainstream literature.
