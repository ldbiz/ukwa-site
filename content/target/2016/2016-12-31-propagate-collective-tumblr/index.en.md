Propagate Collective produces visuals to amplify grassroots social struggles and was set up as a collective for discussion, production and action around visual communication.

Propagate works with a diversity of struggles that include, but are not limited to, housing justice, migrants rights, anti-cuts and anti-austerity policies, workers rights, equality, and LGTB rights. 

Their aim is to stimulate and contribute to collective action to reclaim our city through participatory and collective reflection and action, and by organizing workshops and producing visuals.
