Drawing on figures from the ONS and workforce data from the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care, this research found 84,000 European Economic Area (EEA) migrants currently work in the social care workforce - out of a total workforce of 1.43m. Around 78,000 of these EEA workers do not have British citizenship and so their jobs would be at risk if Britain pulls out of the EU. The risk is made worse by failures to recruit enough British-born workers to meet the increasing demands of an ageing population.
