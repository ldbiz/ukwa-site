On 3 November 2016, the High Court of England and Wales handed down a judgment in which it held that the Secretary of State does not have power under the Crownâ€™s prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the UK to withdraw from the European Union. This briefing examines responses to the judgment at Westminster and in the devolved administrations.
