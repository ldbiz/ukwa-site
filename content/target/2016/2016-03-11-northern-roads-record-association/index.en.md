The Northern Road Records Association was formed in 1890 and its objectives are to receive and examine claims in respect of record attempts accomplished by cyclists within the area of the NRRA. Also, to issue certificates where claims to record performances are established, and to prevent and/or expose the publication of fictitious or unauthenicated claims.
