Brexit would run directly contrary to the interests of the Baltic States. Albeit not cataclysmic in itself, UK secession from the EU would establish a dangerous precedent, challenging the very principles and ideological foundation of the union. Since regaining independence in 1991, Latvia has made an irreversible pro-European choice, and it would benefit tremendously should the United Kingdom do the same in 2017.
