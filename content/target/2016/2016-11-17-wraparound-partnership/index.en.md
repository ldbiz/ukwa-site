Wraparound Partnership is a social enterprise working to help individuals with Special needs and their families reach their full potential. 
As a social enterprise they are driven to maximise social impact rather than profit. They fundamentally believe that co-ordination, collaboration and conversation between the individuals, families and the organisations that support them is key to achievement, and their goal is to ensure this happens.
