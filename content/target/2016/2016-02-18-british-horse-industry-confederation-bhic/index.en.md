The formation of the BHIC was spearheaded by Michael Clayton (then BHS Chairman) and Tristram Ricketts (BHB) together with Lord Donoughue, who had served as an Agriculture Minister, and who had seen at first hand the lack of profile and fragmentation of horse organizations within government policy making and lobbying circles. This umbrella body was formed and for the first time ever brought together both racing and sports horse and other equine organisations.
