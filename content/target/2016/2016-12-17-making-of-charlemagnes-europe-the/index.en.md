The 'Making of Charlemagne's Europe' project, which ran from January 2012 to December 2014, was carried out at King's College London by the Department of History and the Department of Digital Humanities and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The first aim of the project is to offer a single, unified database framework for the extraction of prosopographical and socio-economic data found in early medieval legal documents. The second aim is to apply this framework to legal documents surviving from the reign of Charlemagne (25 September 768 to 28 January 814 AD).
