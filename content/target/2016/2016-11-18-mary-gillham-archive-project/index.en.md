Dr Mary Gillham MBE (1921-2013) was a pioneering female naturalist, prolific wildlife author, avid diary keeper and a lecturer at Cardiff University. This is a HLF funded project to commemorating her life's work. She left a significant archive to South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) providing a unique insight into Dr Gillhamâ€™s life and the history of nature conservation in South Wales.
