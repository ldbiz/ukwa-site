Oral and written evidence identified a number of potential risks and opportunities for science in leaving the EU, for example concerning the mobility of scientists, collaborative research opportunities, funding, access to research facilities, regulation and market access, private sector investment, administrative burdens/costs, etc. The Committee sought further contributions on the risks and opportunities of leaving the EU, to allow the Committee to draw together a ‘Risk Assessment’ and a list of risks/opportunities which should feature in the Government’s work to set a new EU/UK negotiating strategy.
