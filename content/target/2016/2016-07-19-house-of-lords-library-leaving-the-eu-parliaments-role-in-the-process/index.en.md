Following the result of the referendum held on 23 June 2016, this House of Lords Library briefing examines what Parliamentâ€™s role would be in the process of withdrawing from the European Union in several key areas: invoking Article 50; overseeing the negotiation process; ratifying agreements; repealing and reviewing domestic legislation.
