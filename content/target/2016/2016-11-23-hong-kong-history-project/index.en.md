The project, hosted at the University of Bristol, and funded by the Hatton Trust, aims to encourage and facilitate the study of the history of Hong Kong in the UK, and to build collaborations with partners in Hong Kong, specifically in terms of collaboration between the University of Bristol and the University of Hong Kong, as well as other interested HEI and community/NGO partners.
