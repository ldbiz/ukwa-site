The NCFA are providing schools with the opportunity to twin their designated areas of play with the Flanders Peace Field. Working in partnership with the Peace Village, Messines, Belgium (site of the 1914 Christmas Truces) the Peace Field Project (PFP) invites schools not only to commemorate the First World War and the Christmas Truces but also to celebrate peace through reflecting on a moment in history that inspires humanitarianism.
