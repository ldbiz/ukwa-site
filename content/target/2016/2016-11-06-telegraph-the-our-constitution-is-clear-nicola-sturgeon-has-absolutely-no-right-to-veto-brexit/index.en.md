Theresa May, the UK government and parliament at Westminster are legally and constitutionally obliged, by acts of parliament, to take the final decisions as to what shape Brexit should take because power over treaties was reserved to Westminister under the devolution settlement. There is no legal or constitutional reason to allow any of the devolved administrations a veto over it.
