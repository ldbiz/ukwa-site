Nailsworth Health Partnership is a registered charity seeking to improve the health and well being of people who live and work in the Nailsworth area by promoting a healthier lifestyle in a healthier environment. They also want to take a lead in providing and sharing information and education. Their aim is not to start from scratch, but to supplement and improve the many existing health related activities in our local community.
