Urbex history of Cane Hill Hospital, Surrey 1882-2009. Cane Hill was the Third Surrey County Pauper Lunatic Asylum, necessitated after the Springfield (1842) and Brookwood (1862) asylums were filled to capacity. Surrey Council (charged with the provision of care for the insane under the 1845 asylum act) therefore re-employed the architect of Brookwood, Charles Henry Howell, to design and build the new asylum, which would be sited on a hilltop overlooking Coulsdon and the Farthing Downs.
