The website of UEL Students Union, who work for students experience at UEL. They do this by making sure that voices are heard by the university, and defend UEL students' rights on a regular basis. They support student Programme Reps, who feed back to university departments to increase the quality of education on behalf of students on their course. They help students to set up societies and groups and train and support them for their extra-curricular ambitions, making sure that the campus is vibrant with student-led events and activities. All of these opportunities including running societies, being a student representative and others will enhance students skills and look great on your CV. The Students Union lobbies the university on behalf of students to ensure that students get the best possible deal, but also work with the university on joint projects such as organising a fantastic Freshers Week in September and other events through the year. Additionally to this, the Students Union supports individual students there is an issue involving studies.
