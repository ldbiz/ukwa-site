The post-referendum economy will follow a very different path from the one the Item Club envisaged in April, which assumed a vote to remain in the EU. Short-term, although the fundamentals will not change, there are likely to be severe confidence effects on spending, only partially cushioned by a fall in the pound. This report forecasts GDP growth of 1.9% this year, followed by just 0.4% next year and 1.4% in 2018.
