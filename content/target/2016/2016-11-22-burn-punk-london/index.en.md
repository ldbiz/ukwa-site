Burn Punk London is a site set up by Joe Corré to protest against Punk London, a series of exhibitions and events in London to mark 40 years since the emergence of punk rock, which Burn Punk London sees as '"the Establishment's castration of an idea with the full acquiescence of the Lumpen Spikey Tops all holding their hands out for a bowl of gruel."  Joe Corré announced that he would burn his collection of punk memorabilia, estimated to be worth £5 million, as a protest and 'reminder to the public' at a live-streamed event on 26 November 2016, the 40th anniversary of the release of the Sex Pistol's debut single 'Anarchy in the U.K'.
