The British Marine Aggregate Producers Association (BMAPA) is the trade body for an industry that contributes some 6.4 per cent of the construction aggregates consumed in Britain.

BMAPA is part of the Mineral Products Association, the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, lime, mortar and silica sand industries.

Working closely with the MPA, BMAPA represents its members in dealings with stakeholders at all levels, ranging from national and local government to local communities.
