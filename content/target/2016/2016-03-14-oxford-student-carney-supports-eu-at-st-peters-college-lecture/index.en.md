Mark Carney, giving the Cairncross Lecture for St Peterâ€™s College at the Sheldonian Theatre, praised the role of the European Union in helping the UK maximize the benefits of its open economy. He did add that the EU needed to offer sufficient safeguards to ensure the British economy did not suffer ill effects from any shocks within the Eurozone.
