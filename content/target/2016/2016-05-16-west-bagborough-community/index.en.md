The village of West Bagborough is the main village in the Parish. The parish stretches from the A358 to the West, Triscombe to the North, Shopnoller to the South and to Birches Corner in the East.  It also incorporates much of Lydeard Hill open country and common ground. Most of the Parish nestles on the western slopes of the Quantock Hills within the Quantock Hills A.O.N.B.
