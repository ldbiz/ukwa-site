An emergency debate on the process of leaving the EU in the House of Commons. The House resolved that there should be a full and transparent debate on the Governmentâ€™s plan for leaving the EU; and calls on the Prime Minister to ensure that this House is able properly to scrutinise that plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked.
