The Campaign for an Independent Britain is a non-party political campaigning organisation of people from all walks of life who recognize that continuing British membership of the European Union poses grave threats to our liberties, independence, and economic prosperity. It believes that Britain should leave the European Union and that the corrupt, undemocratic, obsolete and fraud-ridden EU should be superseded by modern, democratic structures that enable the peoples of Europe to co-operate without loss of any nationâ€™s freedoms and way of life
