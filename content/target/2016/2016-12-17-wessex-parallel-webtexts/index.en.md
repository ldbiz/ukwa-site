Wessex Parallel WebTexts is a project which aims to link research and teaching by producing scholarly but accessible electronic editions as an on-line learning resource. Its website offers an anthology of edited Middle English lyrics (concentrating particularly on the 'Harley Lyrics'), translations of some longer Middle English works, and background resources for use in teaching.
