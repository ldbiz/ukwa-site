The European Data in Health Research Alliance brings together academic, patient and research organisations from across Europe. Together, we are committed to ensuring that the Data Protection Regulation allows the seminal research that has taken place for many years to continue by ensuring research is not subject to an obligation to ask specific consent when personal data is used.
