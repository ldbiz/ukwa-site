This site was produced by a collaboration between academics at Goldsmiths and two London schools as an AHRC project funded through the Gateways centre at the University of Kent (http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/projects/francophones-in-london) It was unusual in being a bilingual project involving a Newham sixth form college and a Francophone school in Kensington.  In 2017, it won the Goldsmiths Warden's Prize for Public Engagement.  It would be an important part of the legacy of the project, and the legacy of the 2014-18 First World War Centenary, to have the site preserved by the British Library.
