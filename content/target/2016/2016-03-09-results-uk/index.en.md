RESULTS is an international NGO that uses advocacy and campaigning to bring about the end of extreme poverty. They do that by recruiting, training and inspiring hundreds of volunteers around the world to speak up and call for change. They call on the governments of wealthy nations to spend more money on overseas aid, to spend the money they spend more effectively and efficiently and to ensure that anything they support reaches the poorest and most vulnerable people all the time.

In the UK we have a diverse network of volunteer led, grassroots groups that meet every month to learn the reasons people are kept in poverty and to take coordinated and effective action to make change.
