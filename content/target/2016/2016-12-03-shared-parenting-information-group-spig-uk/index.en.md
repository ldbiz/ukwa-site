A UK website devoted to encouraging and promoting the concept of responsible Shared Parenting after separation or divorce. Established in 1996. It displays statistics for individual court outcomes. It has an article base to more than 580 articles of parenting, separation and divorce. As a result of the authors retirement it is no longer updated, but it is kept up on the internet as it is hoped that the information it contains continues to be useful to separated parents.
