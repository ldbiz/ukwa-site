The Lewy Body Society was founded in 2006 in order to support research into DLB and to raise awareness and educate the public, the medical profession and those in healthcare decision-making positions about the disease. The first LBS funded research was a PhD studentship in molecular genetics which began in 2007. The Society is currently funding research at Cambridge, (University College) London, Newcastle and Southampton Universities.
