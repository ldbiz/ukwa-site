Leaving the European Union will require major changes to the statute book. On 2 October 2016, the Prime Minister announced plans to introduce a “Great Repeal Bill” in the next Queen's Speech. The Great Repeal Bill has not yet been published. This paper considers issues likely to be raised in the Bill. It works on the basis of comments made by senior members of the Government (set out in Section 1).
