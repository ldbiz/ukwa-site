Conscience campaigns for a progressive increase in the amount of UK tax spent on peacebuilding, and a corresponding decrease in the amount spent on war and preparation for war. They also campaign for the legal right of those with a conscientious objection to war to have the entire military part of their taxes spent on peacebuilding.
