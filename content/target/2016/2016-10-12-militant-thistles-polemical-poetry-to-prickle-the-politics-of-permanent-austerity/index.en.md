Militant Thistles is the new sister site to The Recusant, and is specifically here to publish politically topical poems of a left-wing/socialist persuasion in oppositional response to the policies of "permanent austerity". We 'Thistles' aim to be permanent thorns in the sides of Tories and establishment torch-carriers alike
