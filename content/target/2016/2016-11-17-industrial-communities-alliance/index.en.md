The Industrial Communities Alliance is the local authority association campaigning on behalf of councils in the industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales.

Their areas include many of the most deprived in the country, with a wide range of problems that can be traced back to job loss and economic restructuring.

The Industrial Communities Alliance brings together two long established local authority groupings -  Coalfield Communities Campaign and Steel Action. It also includes former textile, shipbuilding and manufacturing areas.

The Alliance builds on nearly twenty-five years experience of effective lobbying â€“ in Westminster, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Brussels.

Over sixty local Authorities, across nine regions, make up the membership of the Industrial Communities Alliance.
