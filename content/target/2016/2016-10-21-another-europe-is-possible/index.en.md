Another Europe Is Possible is the campaign for a radical ‘in’ vote in the EU referendum on 23rd June 2016. 
Following the result of the referendum it continues to campaign to defend the four pillars highlighted as at risk from Brexit: environmental sustainability, human rights, workplace protections, and free movement. It also argues for a referendum on the terms of exit once they have been negotiated with Europe.
