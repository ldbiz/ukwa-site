Since its formation in 2003, the UKAWJ has welcomed members of both sexes and from all levels of the judiciary, including salaried and fee paid judges in courts and tribunals, and from all jurisdictions in the United Kingdom. Their focus is on matters of particular concern to women, principally the issues they face in the law and the justice system as well as issues of particular concern to women judges.
