This project will enable young people to gain an understanding of what children and young people of 1914 - 1918 had to experience. Using a range of research methods, participants will collect memorabilia and information from the war period and create a mural using old photographs as well as designing a collage using handmade poppies of a poignant image from the war. Along with this a large part of the project will also be to interview local people who have tales to tell and experiences to share from their family members who were youngsters during this period. Participants on the project will identify a key story to produce a visual storyboard that will capture the true essence of life during the war for children. The work that will be produced will be exhibited throughout North Tyneside at various venues including libraries, schools, YMCA uilding during 2014. To mark the 100 year anniversary outbreak of the First World War in 2014, this project will engage young people in the area to give an insight and better understanding of the war. This will be the first project that will lend itself to a larger project to take place during the commemorative year.
