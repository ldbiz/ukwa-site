Vivid Economics produced two reports on the impact of Brexit on the UK energy industry for the National Grid. The first report found that found that the overall impacts of Brexit on the energy sector are likely to be negative. Any potential benefits of Brexit are likely to be limited, given that the UK is committed to decarbonisation and air quality targets equal to or greater than EU requirements. A later broader assessment found that the increase in the cost of investment due to the uncertainty arising from Brexit negotiations could also be a significant cost, given that the UK is undertaking a historic level of investment in energy infrastructure.
