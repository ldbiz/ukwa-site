The 'Heritage of Somalis in Wales project' is an introduction to a database of Somali seamen working in British waters pre-1950â€™s, taken from the 1.25 million CR index and identity card archives of UK sailors. The project also captures the memories of Somali seamen who lived and worked in South Wales. It will be a historical record of the Somali people in Wales.
