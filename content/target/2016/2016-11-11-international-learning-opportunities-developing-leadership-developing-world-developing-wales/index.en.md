The International Learning Opportunities (ILO) programme offers you a fantastic opportunity to work for 8 weeks in either Lesotho (in Southern Africa) or Eastern Uganda on projects that support these developing countries and stretch your personal and professional skills. The International Learning Opportunities Programme is funded by the Wales for Africa Programme and delivered through AcademiWales and Wales for Africa by Bridges and Links 2 Africa.

The Wales for Africa Programme was set up by the Welsh Government to encourage Wales to do more in support of international development and disaster relief.
