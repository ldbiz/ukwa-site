The Party for Freedom (Dutch: Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) is a right-wing populist  political party in the Netherlands which supports withdrawal from the EU. Founded in 2005 as the successor to Geert Wilders' one-man party in the House of Representatives, it won nine seats in the 2006 general election making it the fifth-largest party in parliament. In the 2010 general election it won 24 seats, making it the third-largest party. At that time the PVV agreed to support the minority government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte without having ministers in the cabinet. However the PVV withdrew its support in April 2012 due to differences over budget cuts.[14] It came third in the 2014 European Parliament election, winning four out of 26 seats.
