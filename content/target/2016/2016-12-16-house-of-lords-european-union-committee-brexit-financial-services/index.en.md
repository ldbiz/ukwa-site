The financial services industry constitutes around 7% of UK GDP, directly
employs 1.1 million people, two-thirds of them outside London, and
contributes a significant proportion of tax revenue. Avoiding major disruption
to this industry and the resulting job losses should be a high priority in the
Government’s negotiations on leaving the EU. This report examines the likely
impacts of Brexit on UK financial services and seeks to identify issues that the
Government will have to contend with as it attempts to reach deals on the UK’s withdrawal terms and its future relationship with the EU.
