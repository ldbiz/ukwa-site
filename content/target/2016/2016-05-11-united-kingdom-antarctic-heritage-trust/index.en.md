The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) was established in 1993. Initially working to support the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZAHT) in raising funds for the conservation of heroic-era huts in the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica, in 1993 UKAHT was born through the vision and energy of founding Chairman John Hamilton, who was inspired by the need to recognise and conserve Britainâ€™s long and distinguished history of exploration and scientific research.
