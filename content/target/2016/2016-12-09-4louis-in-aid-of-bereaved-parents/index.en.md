4Louis is a charity that provides memory boxes for stillbirth, neo-natal, infant and child loss. As grieving Angel mum's we decided we wanted to do something to help make a devastating experience a little more bearable by letting families know they are not alone. We do this by providing hospitals across the U.K with memory boxes, so angel parents can capture as many memories as they can.
