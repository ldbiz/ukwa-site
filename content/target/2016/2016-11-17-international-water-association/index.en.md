Water underpins every aspect of human and environmental existence. The severe water challenges facing the world today require an unprecedented global response. IWA members and staff are situated in 130 countries worldwide, forming the largest international network of water professionals working towards a water wise world.
Innovative, solutions- and service- oriented, they work across a range of areas that contribute to the progression of water management worldwide. Their programmes develop research and projects focused on solutions for water and wastewater management; they organise events that bring the latest science, technology and best practice to the water sector at large; they work to place water on the global political agenda and to influence best practice in regulation and policy making; and they provide services to IWAâ€™s global membership.
