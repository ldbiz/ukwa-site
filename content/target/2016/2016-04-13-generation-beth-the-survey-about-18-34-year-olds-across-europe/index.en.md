Generation What is an interactive program and a large-scale survey conducted in France in 2013 to draw the portrait of the current generation of 15-34 year olds. This time, 10 countries have joined us for the purpose of making this program a truly European event: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Luxemburg, Holland, Wales, and the Czech Republic. The Wales project is brought to you by S4C.
