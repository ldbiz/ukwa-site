Loch of Shining Waters started as a non-profit voluntary group which was officially launched on the 1st January 2010 as a community resource site for Lochgelly, with the aim to highlight local positive and negative developments to (a) raise awareness to the wider online public, and (b) encourage local open debate online & offline.
