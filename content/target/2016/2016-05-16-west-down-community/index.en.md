West Down website is created for, and run by the residents of West Down.  It has been developed by a sub committee of the Parish Hall and it is intended that there will be a small management group which will oversee the site, content and future developments.

Itsâ€™ purpose is to inform the locals of what is going on in this busy village and to tell the world outside what we have to offer.
