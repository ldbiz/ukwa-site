In partnership with the Yorkshire & the Humber Arts Council England Bridge organisation CapeUK, Breeze Culture Network are bringing a tried and tested online one-stop-shop for professionals and volunteers searching for high quality creative activities for the children and young people the work with, and partnerships with those delivering them, to the whole region.
 
They aim to increase the menu of opportunities for all children and young people in the region by sharing and connecting with organisations and practitioners delivering quality activities, opportunities, news and ideas.
 
Breeze Culture Network's online Directory is used by schools and community groups to search for arts organisations and practitioners. Those arts organisations and practitioners create their own online profile on the Directory promoting what they do.
