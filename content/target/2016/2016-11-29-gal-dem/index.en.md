gal-dem is a creative magazine (online and in print) comprised of over 70 women of colour. Most of our team are based in the UK, but we do have a few from farther afield including the States and South America. The aim of gal-dem is to open up our take on the world to a wider audience. We want people of different shapes, sizes, genders and ethnic backgrounds to engage with the work we are doing. It is no secret that the mainstream media doesnâ€™t represent or reflect us, so we are doing it for ourselves.
