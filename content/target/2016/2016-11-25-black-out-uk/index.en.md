BlackOut UK is a not-for-profit social enterprise run and owned by a volunteer collective of black gay men. We recognize and celebrate the diversity of experience and views among black queer men in the UK (extending even to what we call ourselves) and are seeking to create spaces to explore and reflect on our commonalities and differences.
