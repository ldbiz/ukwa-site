Politeia is a forum for discussing economic, constitutional and social policy. It focuses on the role of the state in peopleâ€™s lives. Politeia aims to encourage the best policies for a free society under the rule of law, a prosperous economy based on free markets and competition, and excellent systems for education, health care and pensions.
