Founded in 2011, Wonkhe (pronounced wonky) is the home of higher education wonks: those who work in and around universities and anyone interested and engaged in higher education policy, people and politics. Their mission is to improve policymaking in higher education and provide a platform for the new or previously unheard voices and perspectives in the sector. Wonkhe is not partisan and not aligned to any particular policies, politics or interests.
