The Whig Party is Britainâ€™s oldest progressive political party, and was originally founded in 1678. For hundreds of years Whigs developed the British constitution by fighting for equal rights for minorities, and promoting democracy and human rights. The Whigs established the fundamental British principles that all citizens are equal before the law, and that the law of Parliament is supreme over the Crown and the crowd.
