Moorland Association members are responsible for over a million acres of the moorlands of England and Wales. This includes 860,000 acres of upland heather representing almost all of this precious habitat south of the Scottish Border.  The Moorland Association was set up in 1986 to tackle serious damage done to landscapes, dating back to the Second World War.
