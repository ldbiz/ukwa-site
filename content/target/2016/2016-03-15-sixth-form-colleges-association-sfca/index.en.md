The Sixth Form Collegesâ€™ Association (SFCA) has been representing the interests of the sector since Sixth Form Colleges became independent corporations in 1993. Since that time, the role of SFCA has evolved considerably. While the main role of the Association is still to negotiate national pay and conditions with the trade unions that represent teaching and support staff, the organisation has three other key functions:

 
Representing Sixth Form Colleges: particularly in discussions and negotiations with officials from government departments and agencies.Promoting Sixth Form Colleges: to a wide range of stakeholders including the media, politicians and potential students.Supporting Sixth Form Colleges: on a range of issues (including HR, funding and industrial relations) through the provision of research, guidance and one to one advice.
