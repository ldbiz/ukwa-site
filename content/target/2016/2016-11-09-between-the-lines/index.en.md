Between the Lines is an exhibition held at the Senedd Gallery in 2016. It 'focuses on the contribution individuals make to achieve the community they wish to live in. It offers an insight into what motivates people who actively contribute to the wellbeing of their community and how their actions help and inspire others. It shines a light on who these people are and what they value. Through the combined mediums of pencil drawings, black and white film photographs and written reflections a unique record of community life in Wales and the U.K. is being documented'.
