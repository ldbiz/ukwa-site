Stephen Crabb stood as Conservative candidate for Preseli Pembrokeshire at the 2005 general election and was elected to serve as MP. He was subsequently re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2017. His Twitter account reflects his bid to become leader of the Conservative Party following the resignation of David Cameron as prime minister in June 2016.
