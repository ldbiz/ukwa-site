The Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association (IMLA) is the trade association that represents the views and interests of UK mortgage lenders involved in the generation of mortgage business via professional financial intermediaries. Its members include the intermediary based arms of banks and building societies and a range of specialist lenders who are entirely intermediary-based in terms of their sales distribution channel. IMLA is an active member focussed, business to business trade body with close working relationships with individual firms and key stakeholders including the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries (AMI), the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
