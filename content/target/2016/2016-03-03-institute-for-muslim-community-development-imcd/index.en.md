IMCD is a fledgling think-tank which launched into action in late 2014 drawing on the hugely broad and diverse multidisciplinary 30-year experience of its founding members in the fields of media, arts, culture, politics, human rights, and education.

IMCD aims to fill a gap in the activities of Muslim community organisations: solution-focused and visionary thinking culminating in the design of bespoke interventions and models of community excellence.

Many Muslims are working in the capacity of local community development while there is a vacuum in the arena of national Muslim community development where we face enormous common challenges, threats and absence of vision crucial to achieving our Islamic societal objectives.

IMCD puts itself forward as the first “think tank” focused solely on the development of the Muslim community of Britain at a national level.
