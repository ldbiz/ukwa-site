Look and Learn is a London-based picture library specialising in educational images. The core of the picture library derives from rights to material that appeared in sixteen classic childrenâ€™s illustrated magazines, including Look and Learn (1962-82). This material is complemented by illustrations from a wide range of 19th and early 20th century printed books and magazines, and by fine art and historical images provided by Bridgeman Education.
