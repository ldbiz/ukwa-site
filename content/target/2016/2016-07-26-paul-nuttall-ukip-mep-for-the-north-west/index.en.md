Paul Nuttall stood as UKIP candidate for the North West at the 2009 European Parliament election and was elected to serve as MEP.  He was leader of UKIP from November 2016 to June 2017. Nuttall stood unsuccessfully for UKIP six times in parliamentary elections since 2005, of which his best result was finishing second in the 2017 Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election.
