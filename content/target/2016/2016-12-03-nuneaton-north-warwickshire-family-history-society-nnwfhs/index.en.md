The Nuneaton & North Warwickshire Family History Society is run by a committee of elected volunteer members.  The committee is a relatively small group of individuals who give their time freely, and generously, to work for the benefit of our Society and for family history in north Warwickshire generally.  The committee is elected annually at a general meeting. NNWFHS is an independent organisation and a member of the Federation of Family History Societies.
