The Fundraising Regulator is the independent regulator of charitable fundraising. They were established following the Etherington review of fundraising self-regulation (2015) to strengthen the system of charity regulation and restore public trust in fundraising. Previous to this the Fundraising Standards Board (FRSB) ran the UKâ€™s self-regulatory scheme for fundraising.
