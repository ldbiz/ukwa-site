Teaching the Codex was launched with a colloquium at Merton College Oxford on 6th February 2016 as a special event in the calendar of Mertonâ€™s History of the Book Group. This event brought together academics from a range of disciplines who are experienced in teaching palaeography and codicology, which enabled a series of discussions on diverse pedagogical approaches. The Teaching the Codex WordPress site will continue to facilitate discussions and resource sharing in a digital forum via monthly guest blog posts.
