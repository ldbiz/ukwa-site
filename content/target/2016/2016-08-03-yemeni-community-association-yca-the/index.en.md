The Yemeni Community Association (YCA) is a small community based organisation that seeks to represent and meet the particular needs of the Yemeni Community in Sandwell. It does this by providing services over and above those available in the mainstream sector, and also by acting as an interface between the community and various service providers. It was registered as an official charity in 1997.
