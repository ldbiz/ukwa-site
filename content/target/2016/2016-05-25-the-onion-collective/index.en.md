Onion Collective is a newly formed Social Enterprise founded by a group of ambitious but socially-minded citizens who all live here in West Somerset.  We aim to  harness and develop the collective expertise built-up during our various career paths and bring it to bear for social and community benefit, driving forward community-based projects with energy, passion and realism.
