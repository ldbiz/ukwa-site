The Muslim Manifesto is a call-to-action and a set of straightforward and inclusive policy recommendations pinpointing key issues of high importance to the Muslim community. It is addressed to all Muslim and non-Muslim British politicians in local councils and parliament whom it is hoped will pledge to back it in the forthcoming 2015 UK General Election on 7th May 2015.  The Muslim Manifesto is a clear statement of intention of relevance to British Muslims of diverse socio-economic background, ethnicity and religious persuasion. Fundamentally it is non-sectarian and not owned by any single organisation or individual; it is a proud move forward, which could forge a more united future for the British Muslim community.
