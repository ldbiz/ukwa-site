FASNA is a national forum for self-governing primary, secondary and special schools, academies and multi-academy trusts. It is a charity and the only ‘not for profit’ national school membership organisation that expressly represents the interests and views of all self-governing schools.

FASNA promotes autonomy for schools enabling them to raise standards for students, believing that autonomous schools are the best vehicle to support creative leadership and school strategies that respond to the needs of the local community.  It believes that this is the best way to raise standards.  Members include CEOs, headteachers, governors, clerks to governors, school business managers and directors. 

FASNA represents the interests of members to Government Ministers, as well as to the Department for Education, and other educational groups and organisations.  FASNA also makes contact with all the political parties to ensure that FASNA's views are understood as party policy is developed. FASNA is a-political.
