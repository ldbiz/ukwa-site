The APPG on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery, with cross-party membership of MPs and Peers, meets to provide a relatively informal forum for evidence-based discussion as to the nature and scale of modern slavery and to seek the means to eradicate it.  

Founded by the former MP, Anthony Steen CBE, the APPG was launched on 9 July 2006 and is currently Chaired by Fiona Mactaggart MP and Baroness Butler-Sloss. 

The secretariat of the APPG is the Human Trafficking Foundation, a registered charity. The APPG is in the register of All-Party Groups.

 

Objectives

"To raise awareness of the scale and effects of human trafficking into the UK and the EU; and to seek solutions to reduce supply and demand; and to improve welfare provisions for victims."

The Group aims to hold the Government to account, to ensure better training for the police, and greater awareness for those involved with border protection. It is committed, above all, to ensuring victims of trafficking are given proper help, consistent with the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.
