While the government has announced that an Act of Parliament – the ‘Great Repeal Bill’ – will be used to give effect to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, it insists that no legislation is required to authorise it to notify the EU of the intended withdrawal under Article 50. This, it says, is because it is constitutionally appropriate for the government to use prerogative powers to withdraw from the EU without the need for further parliamentary approval, and the European Communities Act does not limit or restrict the prerogative. This position is being challenged in the High Court by citizens seeking a declaration that Article 50 may only be triggered following a parliamentary vote
