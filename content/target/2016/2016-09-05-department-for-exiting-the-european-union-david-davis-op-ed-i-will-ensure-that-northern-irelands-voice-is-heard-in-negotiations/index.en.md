Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis wrote in the Belfast Telegraph ahead of his trip to Northern Ireland that he would  ensure that Northern Irelandâ€™s voice was heard as the government worked towards a Brexit deal that enabled every part of the UK to build on what it has achieved and embrace new opportunities.
