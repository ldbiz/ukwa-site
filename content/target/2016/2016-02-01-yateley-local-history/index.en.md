This website was initially set up by P J Tipton to place in the public domain the text of the Yateley Society's annual local history exhibitions mounted each year in Yateley Library from 1997 to 2005. This exhibition text was later supplemented by Dr R H Johnston and Peter Tipton from the Society's growing digital archive by adding other local history material which was either out-of-copyright or within the copyright of the site's two administrators. The intention was to place into the public domain resources for researching Yateley's local history and for researching the family histories of persons with ancestors living in Yateley.
