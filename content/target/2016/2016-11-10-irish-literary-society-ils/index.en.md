The Irish Literary Society was established in London in 1892. Among its founders were W B Yeats and Douglas Hyde and other leaders of the Irish Literary Revival.
The object of the Society is to promote the study of Irish literature and allied artistic forms and to provide a forum for intellectual and social activities in connection with these interests.
