The Gallipoli campaign was fought in a quiet corner of Turkey, but made the Great War into a World War. Today, people look back at the costly campaign with very different feelings – pride, shame, anger, sorrow – depending on which country they live in.  Through this exciting educational project, schools from all over the world are sharing their stories.
