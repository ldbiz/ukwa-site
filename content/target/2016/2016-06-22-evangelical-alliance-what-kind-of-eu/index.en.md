The Evangelical Alliance takes no position on whether the UK should leave or remain. Its position is only that Christians should engage fully in the debate and vote in the referendum - because the voice of evangelicals matters. Ahead of the referendum they look at four themes that will hopefully help Christians think about some of the underlying issues relating to EU membership. These are designed to provoke thought and prayer, and help Christians consider how they might vote. There are in depth articles on identity, freedom, democracy and economy, along with other resources and information
