The Margaret Thatcher Foundation was formed in 1991 to advance the cause of political and economic freedom. The Foundation has five broad goals:promotion the acceptance of democracy, market principles, the rule of law, and strong defence; encouraging strong transatlantic links between Britain, Europe, and North America; assisting and encouraging the peoples of the former communist countries and other oppressive regimes across the world as they adopt democracy; fostering greater contact between Western nations and those of the Middle East and supporting free trade throughout the world.
