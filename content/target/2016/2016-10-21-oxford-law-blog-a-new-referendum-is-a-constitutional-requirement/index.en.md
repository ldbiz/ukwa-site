Argues that any proposed new treaty between the UK and the EU that seeks to replace EU membership with a set of new trade agreements will most likely have to be approved by way of a new referendum according to the framework created by the European Union Act 2011. The question would be about the proposed new treaty or set of treaties with the EU, which would have been agreed after a lengthy and probably laborious process as the best possible deal available to the UK. If the answer to this referendum is affirmative to the new treaty, then the new agreement replacing membership of the EU with another type of relationship will have been approved and will take effect. But if the answer is ‘no’ to the new agreement, then the status quo, namely continuing membership of the EU, will have received a renewed mandate by the electorate as a preferable state of affairs to the best available alternative. The electorate would have chosen to remain. At that point the government would have to revoke the Article 50 notification and the UK would continue being a member of the EU.
