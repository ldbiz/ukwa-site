Stonehouse Farm is located in West Harling, Norfolk. They are a mixed livestock farm producing high genetic value breeding animals.  They run 1200 breeding sheep including pedigree Lleyns and 150 suckler cows, all put to Stabiliser bulls, across more than 2500 acres of organic land.  The key to the business is maximising the value of the animals as they are run on some of the poorest land in the country.
