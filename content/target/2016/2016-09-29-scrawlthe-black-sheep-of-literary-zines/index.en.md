The online literary magazine The Scrawl, is now its main manifestation. 
The Scrawl began as a magazine on paper in the year 2000 and produced 
two issues with support from Arts Council of Wales before transferring 
to the on-line format. It is now an on-line e-zine only which still 
regularly up-dates with new content.
