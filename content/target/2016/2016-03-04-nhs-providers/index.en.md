NHS Providers is the membership organisation and trade association for NHS acute, ambulance, community and mental health services that treat patients and service users in the NHS.  They aim to help those foundation trusts and trusts to deliver high quality, patient focused, care by enabling them to learn from each other, acting as their public voice and helping shape the system in which they operate.
