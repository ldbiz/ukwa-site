Awel was established in 2015 by Awel Aman Tawe (AAT), a community energy charity. It offers the opportunity to directly own Welsh wind generation and profits will be used to support local charity Awel Aman Tawe in tackling fuel poverty and developing other renewable energy projects in the Swansea Valley. Awel will own and run two 2.35MW Enercon wind turbines on Mynydd y Gwrhyd, 20 miles north of Swansea.
