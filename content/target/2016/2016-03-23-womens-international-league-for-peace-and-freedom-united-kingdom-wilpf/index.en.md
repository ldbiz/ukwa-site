WILPF is a membership-based organisation and its highest decision making body is the Triennial International Congress (TIC). Since their establishment in 1915, they have brought together women from around the world who are united in working for peace by non-violent means and promoting political, economic and social justice for all. This is the website for the UK branch of WILPF.
