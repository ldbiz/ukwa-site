Seintiau is a site dedicated to research on the saints of Wales. The Cult of Saints in Wales project will publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts about saints. Many of these texts have never been edited before, while those editions that do exist are widely scattered and of very variable quality.
