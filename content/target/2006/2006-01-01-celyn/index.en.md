Celyn was a Welsh ‘green left’ review, published with volunteer support and donations, via a not-for-profit collective. Celyn brought people together from different political traditions and fostered respectful, non-tribal communication. Its editorial team included Nick Davies, Gordon Gibson, Marc Jones, Darren Williams and Leanne Wood. The blog was published between 2011 and 2012.
