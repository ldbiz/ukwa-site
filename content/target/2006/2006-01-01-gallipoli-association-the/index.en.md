The Gallipoli Association objectives are to advance education for the public benefit by raising public awareness of the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915 and by encouraging and facilitating the study in the legacy and lessons of that Campaign, keeping alive the memory of the Campaign and ensuring that all who fought or served in it, and those who gave their lives, are not forgotten.
