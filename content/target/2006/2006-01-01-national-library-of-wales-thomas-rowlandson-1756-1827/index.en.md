Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827) was a fine watercolour portrait artist. The bulk of the Rowlandson collection at the National Library of Wales stem from his landscape studies in Britain with the majority representing the Welsh landscape. Much of the collection was digitised by the National Library of Wales.
