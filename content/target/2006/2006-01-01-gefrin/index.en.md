Gefrin.com has been up and running since 1995 and was originally five pages hosted on Demon Internet. The site has been through several changes of style and the content has expanded considerably. The site is designed and maintained using Adobe Dreamweaver and an open source web development tool called Kompozer. I avoid spinning flashy things on screen which possibly look cool initially but eventually become distractions.
