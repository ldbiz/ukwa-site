Nine Wells is a small settlement which straddles the A 487, 1 mile west of Solva and 2 miles short of St Davids. The web site was created when Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority considered demolishing the historic Water Tower which supplied the City of St Davids with water for some 60 years.
