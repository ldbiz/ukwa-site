Emmanuel Macron warned Theresa May that he stood firmly behind EU negotiators as he refused to break ranks over Brexit. The Prime Minister had cut short her holiday in Italy to meet with the French president to set out her Chequers plan. A source in Mr Macron’s office said the EU’s chief negotiator Mr Barnier has maintained that any Brexit deal ‘must conform with the economic interests of the 27 remaining EU members, and the president has always supported this as well.’
