Informative site giving access to scholarly articles on the composer Louis Spohr (published between 1970 and 2016 in the now defunct 'Spohr Journal' and since digitised), as well as details of his life and works, news of Spohr-related events and a bibliography. The Society no longer exists; having voluntarily designed the site many years ago, I now maintain it at my own cost, with the help of some former members, as a service to music.
