“In January 2006, I was seconded from my usual role in Wales to work for Oxfam’s Tsunami Relief programme in Aceh, Indonesia. My work and travels took me not only around the beautiful province of Aceh in Northern Sumatra, where I lived until July, but also to New Zealand, Bali, Borneo, Malaysia, Thailand and most memorably to Java, where I was part of the emergency response team on the ground in the first days after the Jogjakarta Earthquake. My Blog is the story of my travels, and more importantly, of the people I met. It was a life changing trip to the heart of humanity.” - Craig Owen (blog introduction).
