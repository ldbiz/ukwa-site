<p>Text of the speech given by Mark Carney, Govenor of the Bank of England, in Edinburgh on 29 January 2014. The speech set out issues relating to a currency union between an independent Scotland and the UK, and began by emphasising that decisions over currency union were political, to be worked out between parliaments at Westminster and Edinburgh, and implemented, if required, by the Bank of England.</p>
