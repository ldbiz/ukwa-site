No 2 lorries in Bute Park was a campaign opposing Cardiff Council building a new vehicular and pedestrian bridge and road for articulated lorries on the CADW/Icomos register of parks and gardens of specific historic interest in Wales. Green campaigners claimed the peace and tranquillity of Cardiff's Bute Park was is in danger of disappearing amid council plans to improve its access. The blog was published between 2008 and 2011.
