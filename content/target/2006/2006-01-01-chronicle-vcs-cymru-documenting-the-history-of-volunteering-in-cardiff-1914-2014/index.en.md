Chronicle is a two-year volunteering-based community heritage project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and overseen by VCS Cymru. The project will research, collate, digitise, and make publicly available the story of charities and volunteering in the Southern Arc of Cardiff from 1914 to 2014. The Chronicle Project will explore historical records related to volunteering in Cardiff archives, museums and libraries, including the records kept by Cardiff voluntary organisations, and collect the oral stories of past volunteering from local residents.
