<p>The 'Strathclyde Report' issued by Scottish Conservatives on 2nd June 2014. This sets out the Conservative plan for increased devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament in the event of a 'no'vote in the independence referendum. Policy recommendations include further devolution of powers over personal taxation, and powers to 'top up' welfare spending in Scotland.</p>
