These pages were written as part of a project to catalogue and conserve an archive of material relating to the Aberfan disaster held at Merthyr Tydfil and Dowlais libraries. They provide an overview of the circumstances surrounding the disaster and a guide and link to the more detailed sources of information available elsewhere. These pages were written and designed by Martin Johnes and Iain McLean and the work was funded by the British Academy.
