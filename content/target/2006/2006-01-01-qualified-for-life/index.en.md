<p>A review of qualifications for 14 -19 year olds in Wales was ordered by Welsh Government in September 2011. In November 2012, the reviewers presented their final report to Government, and all 42 recommendations were accepted in full.<br />
This website is the result of this review and created to disseminate information on improving the qualifications system in Wales. The Review of Qualifications was overseen by an independent project board with an external Chair, and heard impartial views and evidence from a wide range of stakeholders, including teachers, students, parents and business leaders, as well as academics and policy-makers.</p>
