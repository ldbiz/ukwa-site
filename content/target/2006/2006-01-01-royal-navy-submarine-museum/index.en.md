A museum dedicated to telling the story of the Royal Navy’s submarine service, visitors can go onboard the submarines. Set on the site on the submarine service’s 20th century base on the Gosport side of Portsmouth Harbour, the museum is home to the Royal Navy’s very first submarine Holland 1 and WW2 era submarines, HMS Alliance and midget X24.
