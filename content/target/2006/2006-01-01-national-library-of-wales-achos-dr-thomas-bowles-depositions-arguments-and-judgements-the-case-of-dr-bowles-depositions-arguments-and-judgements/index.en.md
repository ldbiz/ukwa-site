This is a National Library of Wales Digital exhibition. This pamphlet, published by the Honourable Society of the Cymmrodorion in 1773, relates to the case of Dr Thomas Bowles (1695-1773). He was a non-Welsh speaker who was appointed rector of the parish of Trefdraeth in Anglesey in 1766, an incident that aroused controversy in Wales and within the Anglican Church. At this time parishes in Wales were still under the direct authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury and would remain so until the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1920.
