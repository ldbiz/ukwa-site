Gypsy, Roma and Traveller history month aims to change the way that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities have been written out of British history, resulting in ignorance about who they are.   Ninety years ago the Black community realised how powerful remembering and sharing their history could be. So this June, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities are coming together, with central government backing, to begin the long overdue task of educating the British public about who we are and where we come from.This GRTHM website supported GRTHM between 2008 and 2011. It is no longer maintained and is hosted by the National Association of Teachers of Travellers and Other Professionals (NATT+).
