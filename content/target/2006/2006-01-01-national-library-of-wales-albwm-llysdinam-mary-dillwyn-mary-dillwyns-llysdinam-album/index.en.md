Mary Dillwyn was Wales’s earliest female photographer and she is also one of Britain’s most notable early female photographers. This is the second photographic album by her to be digitised by the Library. The album was created around 1853 before Mary married Reverend Welby in 1857 and left Penlle’r-gaer. The album was bought by the Library in 2007 from the Llysdinam Estate, Breconshire, an estate which came into the ownership of the Dillwyn Llewelyn family in the 1890s.
