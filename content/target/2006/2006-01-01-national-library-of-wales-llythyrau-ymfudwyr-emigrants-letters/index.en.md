This is a National Library of Wales digital exhibition relating to Emigrants Letters. Most of the letters presented here are from Henry Jones (1824-52), who emigrated to Holland Patent, New York, in 1850, and his sister, Mary Jones (1831-61), who emigrated to Ballarat, New South Wales in 1856. They are addressed to members of their family in Llanfihangel-y-Pennant, Gwynedd. Also included (ff. 39-40) are verses by Mary Jones, 'Hiraeth am fy ngwlad'.
