Arfordir (Welsh for coastline) is a project which aims to record, understand and monitor changes in the coastal heritage of Wales and is funded by Cadw. The project brings volunteers together to identify and record coastal heritage sites, and the changes that are happening to them, with help from professional archaeologists.
