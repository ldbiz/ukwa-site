<p>Himalayan balsam was introduced in 1839 and is now recorded throughout Britain. It grows rapidly, spreads easily, out-competes other vegetation and readily colonises new areas and said to be relatively shade tolerant. When the plants die down in winter they leave large bare areas that are sensitive to erosion.</p>
