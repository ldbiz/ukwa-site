Muslim Aid was established in the UK in 1985 by community leaders from 17 Islamic organisations in response to the drought in the Horn of Africa. As a leading and well established faith-based British humanitarian charity, Muslim Aid's work is governed by the teachings of Islam, such as compassion, empathy, generosity and helping others in need. This is implemented through emergency responses and eliminating poverty and its causes by developing innovative and sustainable solutions that enable individuals and their communities to live with dignity.
