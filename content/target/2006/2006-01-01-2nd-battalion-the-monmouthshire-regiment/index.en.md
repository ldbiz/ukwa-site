The 2nd Mons were one of only a small number of Territorial Battalions to have been granted the 1914 Star. The battalion was very much made up of men from Abercarn, Blaenavon, Crumlin, Cwmbran, Llanhilleth, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool, with its headquarters at Pontypool. The site is by David Nicholas, author of the book 'They Fought with Pride: First World War Experiences of the 2nd Battalion, The Monmouthshire Regiment'.
