Manchester International Arts (MIA) was created in 1988 to present international, multi-cultural street art events and festivals in the Greater Manchester area. Most events have taken place outdoors and most are free of charge. Some of the major projects undertaken by MIA include Ona Catalana, Streets Ahead, The Commonwealth Games Festival, The Garden of Delights and Feast - picnic by the lake. MIA have expanded, collaborating on outdoor events in the North of England. The founders and joint- artistic directors are Anne Tucker and Jeremy Shine. The website documents many of the events created by MIA (including an archive of past events), news and communications, and basic information about the company.

Manchester International Arts and Streets Ahead Events are the trading name of MultiCultural Arts Ltd. (Company No 2763418 & Registered Charity No 1015459). 

In 2015, MIA downsized and deposited paper records with Manchester City Council.
