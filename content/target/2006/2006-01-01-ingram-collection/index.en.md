<p>"The Ingram Collection is a unique private collection of Modern British and Contemporary art, the vision of one man, Chris Ingram. He started collecting in 2002 and since then  it has become an expanding and growing collection which includes work by the major artists of the 20th century, and also explores the work of emerging artists of the 21st century, such as Haroon Mirza and Aleah Chapin. The collection is at present on loan to the Lightbox Gallery in Woking, Surrey where it is featured in a regularly changing programme of exhibitions and also on permanent display in the public galleries." - from About, <a href="http://www.ingramcollection.com/about/">http://www.ingramcollection.com/about/</a></p>
