<p>The London Mural Preservation Society aims to protect and promote murals by gathering information from the people involved in their creation, collecting local recollection of the muralâ€™s beginnings and bringing together photos from the past and the present. The society aims to fund restoration and investigate future conservation and protection.</p>
