The Contemporary Small Press project is based in the Department of English, Linguistics, and Cultural Studies at the University of Westminster, and hosted by the Institute of Modern and Contemporary Culture.  Run by Dr Leigh Wilson and Dr Georgina Colby, the project and the site seek to provide a forum for contemporary small publishers of poetry and fiction.
