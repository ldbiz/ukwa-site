The Regional SEN Transition to Employment Initiative, (also known as Real Opportunities), was a project that worked with young people aged 14-19 years old with a Learning Disability, Severe and Complex Needs or an Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Real Opportunities operated between September 2010 and September 2014.  Supported by the European Social Fund, the project was based in 9 local authorities in South Wales: Caerphilly, Bridgend, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr, Pembrokeshire, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, and Torfaen.
