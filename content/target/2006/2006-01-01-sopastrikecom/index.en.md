The SopaStrike is a unique response to the proposed SOPA bill in the USA. Hundreds of websites are blacking out their sites for a 12 hour period, in protest against the SOPA bill. Many UK sites are also participating. These blackouts are a one-off event for a very limited time period, and a superb example of global unity against a socially unpopular internet bill.
