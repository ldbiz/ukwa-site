Accoring to the site, Revive's ;passion is that Revive would be used to build the Church, win the lost and make disciples in the Valleys through passionate gospel preaching, sacrificial serving and persevering prayer'. Revive have been working with churches in and around the Valleys by running Gospel-focused kids clubs and youth clubs, with the intention of getting young people off the streets and into church. The site was no longer live as of 2014.
