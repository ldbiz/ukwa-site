Megan Broadmeadow is a Welsh artist and was awarded the 2015â€“16 Mark Tanner Sculpture Award. Her aims 'are to continue to explore immersivity, and our complex relationships to objects. To understand how objects and environments affect our subconscious, and bring a little touch of magic to peoples lives'.
