According to the site, 'Here we have 7 issues of the magazine ‘Cymro’, created by Welsh prisoners of war during the Second World War. These prisoners were members of the ‘Cymric Club’ in the Stalag IVB camp near Mühlberg, Germany. The magazines were produced between July 1943 and December 1944. The manuscript also contains 2 issues of ‘20 Bees Buzz’, which was an English weekly magazine created by the prisoners of hut 20B in the same camp during January 1945'.
