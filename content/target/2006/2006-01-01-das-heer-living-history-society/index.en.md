Das Heer aims to portray these very ordinary soldiers, and present their lives, equipment and experiences to the public. It also provides a place where collectors and those with an interest in WW2 can meet, discuss, collect and research. We are a group of historians with an interest in WW2, the ordinary German soldier and the period 1939-1941.
