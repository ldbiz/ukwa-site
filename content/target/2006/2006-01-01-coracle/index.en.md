coracle.eu.com offers a virtual network that provides the opportunity for professional development of creative practitioners in all disciplines across Europe. This website was originally developed as an output of a European funded initiative led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David whose project partners were Carlow Institute of Technology, Wexford Arts Centre and the County councils of Wexford and Carmarthenshire.
