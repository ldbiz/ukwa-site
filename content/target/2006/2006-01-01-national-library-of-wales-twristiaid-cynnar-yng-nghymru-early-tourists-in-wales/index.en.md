This is an online exhibition by the National Library of Wales. During the eighteenth century it became fashionable for members of the upper classes to go on a 'grand tour' of Europe, visiting countries such as France, Italy and even Greece. Many of these early tourists recorded their observations on the landscape, traditions and history in journals, some of which were published. This is a digitised version of NLW MS 1340C: A tour to south Wales (1801) and NLW MS 22753B: Tour through Wales (1772).
