Percy Benzie Abery (1877-1948) originated from Folkestone, in Kent. He came to live in Builth Wells in 1898 and bought a small photography business, and in 1911 he moved to larger premises, the West End Studio, where he remained until his death in 1948. The Builth Wells Historical Pageant photograph album includes approximately 160 photographs, newspaper cuttings and other ephemera of the majestic pageant which was performed at the grounds of Llanelwedd Hall on 11 August 1909. The photographs were taken by P B Abery and Wallace Jones. The album was presented to The National Library of Wales by the Builth Wells Development Association. and has been digitised.
