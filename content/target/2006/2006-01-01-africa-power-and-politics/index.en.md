<p>The Africa Power and Politics Programme (APPP) was a collaborative project carried out by institutions in the UK, France, Ghana, Niger, Uganda and the USA, from 2007 to 2012. It sought to identify ways of 'doing politics' that worked best for development in Africa, and to challenge conventional ideas about 'good governance' in African contexts. The project website provides further details on its research themes, and links to the reports produced.</p>
