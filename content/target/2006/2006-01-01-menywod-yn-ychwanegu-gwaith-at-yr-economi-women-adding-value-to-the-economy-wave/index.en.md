According to the site, 'Women Adding Value to the Economy (WAVE) has been created to address workplace and labour market practices, specifically gender earning disparities in employment and self-employment. The aim of the WAVE programme is to contribute to tackling the causes of gender pay gaps in Wales. Our aim is to achieve this through both interrelated and targeted activities, working with employers, employees and self-employed women. WAVE is funded by the Convergence European Social Fund through the Welsh Government.' WAVE is funded by the Convergence European Social Fund through the Welsh Government and based at University of South Wales.
