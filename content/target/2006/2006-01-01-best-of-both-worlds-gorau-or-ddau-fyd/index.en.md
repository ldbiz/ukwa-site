<p>This is a Countryside Council for Wales microsite. According to the site 'Best of Both Worlds is a management approach which helps increase opportunities for the responsible pursuit of adventure activities, outdoor sports and recreation, such as canoeing, cycling, walking and climbing. At the same time, it is committed to conservation of the sensitive environments in which they take place â€“ the nature conservation interests, cultural heritage and landscapes we all value.'</p>
