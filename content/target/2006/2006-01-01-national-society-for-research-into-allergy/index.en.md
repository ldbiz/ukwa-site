The National Society for Research into Allergy was founded in 1980 to provide reliable information and guidance for the person who has reason to believe s/he may be suffering from allergy or intolerance. Our main aim is to see allergy and intolerance accepted and for there to be specialised clinics offering effective treatment set up within NHS Hospital Trusts.
