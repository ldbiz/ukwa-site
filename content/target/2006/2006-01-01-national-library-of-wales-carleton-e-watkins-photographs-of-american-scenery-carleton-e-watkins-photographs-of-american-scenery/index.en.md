Carleton E. Watkins, born in 1829, is considered one of the greatest photographers of the American West. Traveling the western United States, he made thousands of mammoth and imperial plate photographs of the Yosemite Valley, Columbia River, the Sierra Nevada, and the Pacific Coast in Oregon. This album held at the National Library of Wales is thought to be the largest collection and also the only bound album of Watkins' photographs in the United Kingdom. The bulk of the photographs in the Library's collection are thought to have been taken between 1873 and 1883 and have been digitised by the National Library of Wales.
