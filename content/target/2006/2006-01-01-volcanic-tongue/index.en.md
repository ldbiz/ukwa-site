<p>Volcanic Tongue, the underground shop in Glasgow recently announced that it will close after 10 years of activity. Opening in 2004, the shop was run by avant-garde musician Heather Leigh Murray and her husband, writer David Keenan. Over the years the duo have tirelessly supported the kind of avant-garde releases that remain on the fringes of the UK underground. The site represents not just a shop, but a whole community, with weekly updates highlighting experimental music in the UK and around the world.</p>
