The Herbert, Coventry's museum and art gallery, celebrates the city's culture, history and arts. A registered educational charity, situated at the heart of the city centre, the Herbert is also Coventry's creative media centre and history centre. The Herbert is also an accredited vocational learning centre, registered with OCN and OCR. This expertise has led to partnership working with training providers and cultural practitioners across Europe and the Herbert is now a destination for European educators who wish to learn how to use digital media to engage audiences.
