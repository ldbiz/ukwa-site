The NHS in North Wales consulted on proposals for the future of its health services in North Wales in 2006.  The proposals were set out in a document entitled "Designed for North Wales - A vision for the health community and a plan for the major hospital services in North Wales".  The outcome of the consultation was considered by the NHS boards and LHBs of North Wales in Autumn 2006 and agreed upon.
