"Modern British Studies at Birmingham is a research centre  based at the University of Birmingham. Our aim is to explore  new ways of thinking about British society, culture, politics, and economics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As well as providing a focus for academic research and teaching, we hope to establish conversations with alternative voices, community organizations, and local historians. and, in so doing, provide fresh opportunities for rethinking modern British history."
