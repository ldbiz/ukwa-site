<p>Medieval Swansea is 'hybrid digital resource which combines an interactive map of the town c.1300, showing its principal topographical and landscape features, with an electronic edition of the fourteenth-century witness testimonies of the hanging in Swansea of the Welshman 'William Cragh' by William de Briouze, lord of Gower'. It is a cross-institutional, multi-disciplinary research project, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council.</p>
