Thomas Jones, traditionally known as Thomas Jones, Pencerrig, was a Welsh landscape artist of considerable talent and inventiveness. This virtual exhibition commemorates the bicentenary of Thomas Jones's death, whilst at the same time acknowledging a highly important bequest by the late Mrs J. Evan-Thomas of the Memoirs, Account Book, Hafod Sketchbook and watercolours taken in and around Pencerrig. It contains information and images of all the objects in the bequest together with Six views in South Wales and a manuscript Italian Day Book,currently held for safe keeping at the Powys County Archives Office.
