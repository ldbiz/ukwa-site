Amongst the most famous watercolourists of his day, John ‘Warwick’ Smith (1749-1831) was also regarded as a great colourist. Between 1784 and 1806 he frequently visited Wales and became increasingly enchanted by the country. The Library’s collections contain 162 of his watercolour works which are based on his travels in Wales.
