Additives Survivors' Network (UK) was formed in March 2000 developed from the Aspartame Survivors' Network (UK) which was launched in August 1999. Originally, ASN(UK) was primarily brought about by a group of like minded individuals aware of the controversy surrounding the artificial sweetener aspartame and questioning its continued use.
