According to a version of the blueprint seen by the newspaper, the European Research Group was planning to call for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU – and if Brussels refused to grant the deal they advocated falling back on a ‘hard Brexit’ governed by World Trade Organisation rules. The MPs were going to pledge to ‘give everyone a Brexit bonus’ by cutting income tax, business rates, capital gains tax and stamp duty, while the UK’s ‘greater freedom to vary VAT’ after leaving the EU could be exploited by cutting the rates charged on female hygiene products, home insulation and domestic fuel.
