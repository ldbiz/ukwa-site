The fifteen views mentioned in the title of this book, and which form its centrepiece, were produced by J. C. Stadler (fl.1780-1812) from original watercolour drawings by the artist John 'Warwick' Smith (1749-1831). This tour itself was undertaken by Sir James Edward Smith (1759-1828). Hafod, at the top of the Ystwyth Valley in north Ceredigion was the creation of Thomas Johnes (1748-1816), often called Johnes yr Hafod. The house and gardens were considered amongst the finest picturesque estates in Britain.
