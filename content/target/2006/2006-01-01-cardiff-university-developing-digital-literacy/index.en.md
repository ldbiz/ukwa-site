According to the site, 'Digidol aims to embed processes and practices that enable the development of Digital Literacy in all staff and students across all areas and levels of Cardiff University. It is understood that this will be as much about changing attitudes and beliefs, as it will be about realising practical knowledge and skills. Organisational change and effective change management will be key aspects of the project'. The project is funded by JISC as part of the Developing Digital Literacies programme 1which runs from July 2011 to July 2013.
