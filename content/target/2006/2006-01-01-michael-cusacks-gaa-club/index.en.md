Michael Cusacks has been up and running in West London since 2009. The club has gone from strength to strength since then, reaching several finals and achieving huge successes in the London GAA scene. A camogie team was set up in late 2010 and have certainly stamped their mark amongst the other London junior camogie teams. We pride ourselves in being an open and friendly club; we support all our players and committee wherever we can; we are attracting large amounts of children to our club through our youth development, and we hope to grow continuously to eventually become a large GAA club, nurturing players from a young age, right up to adult level.
