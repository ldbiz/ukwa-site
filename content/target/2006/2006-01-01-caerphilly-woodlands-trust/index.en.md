Caerphilly Woodlands Trust (CWT) is a conservation charity based in South Wales.
According to the site, 'the charity was established in 2002 when it worked alongside the Forestry Commission and other local partners to save the woodlands (comprising of ‘the Warren’, ‘Wernddu Woods’ and ‘Coed-Y-Fan’) from the threat of development.  The site could have potentially been used as landfill!'.
