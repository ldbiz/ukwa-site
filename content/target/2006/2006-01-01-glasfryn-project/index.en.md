<p>The Glasfryn Project began as a series of literary and artistic seminars and discussion groups organised by poets Lyndon Davies and Graham Hartill and artist Penny Hallas at Glasfryn in Llangattock, Powys. In collaboration with other groups and practitioners working in various fields, the project became involved in multi-media and multi-practice daylong events such as the Orpheus/Eurydice day, and the Frederick J Fredericks extravaganza of art and poetry in the landscape. Davies and another poet John Goodby also set up the Poetry Jamboree festivals of innovative poetry at Hay on Wye, which ran for four years and for which Glasfryn provided HQ, accommodation and webspace. - (website homepage)</p>
