<p>This pages links to and describes the 'Borderlands' report, produced by ANEC in association with IPPR North, Northumbria University and St Chad's College Durham. The report acknowledges concerns that a Scotland with greater autonomy over taxation and investment initiatives could draw economic development away from the North of England, but also argues that there are opportunities for collaboration and mutual development between the North East (of England), Cumbria and Scotland.</p>
