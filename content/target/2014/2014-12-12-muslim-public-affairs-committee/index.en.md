The Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPACUK), is a grass roots civil liberties pressure group, setup in 2001 to encourage civil engagement within the Muslim community at all levels in the UK. Our main objective is to proactively work to expose and counter the sinister and toxic anti Muslim narrative that is common in mainstream politics and media.
