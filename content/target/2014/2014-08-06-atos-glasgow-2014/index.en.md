<p>Webpages of Atos SE, a French multinational IT services corporation about the XX Commonwealth Games. Atos are supplying IT services to the Games and are an official supporter of the Games. This caused controversy, as had Atos won contracts for the Work Capability Assessment for the Department for Work and Pensions - which includes implementing the DWP's criteria for the treatment of disabled people. This led to protests and petitions about Atos' involvement with the Games.</p>
