<p>The webpage of an exhibition at Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery from 6 June - 28 September 2014 showcasing the work of Scottish painter Alison Watt. It is part of GENERATION, a celebration of Scottish contemporary art of the last 25 years to mark the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Alison Watt's paintings explore the suggestive power of white fabric. They frequently evoke both the presence and absence of the human form.</p>
