<p>Steven Blake will be travelling around the country to see the impact that the Commonwealth Games has throughout Scotland, before, during and after the event itself. During this trip he will be developing an album of new folk music capturing 5 ‘images’ of the affect the Games have had in Scotland, from the perspective of an ‘on-looker’. An album is due to be performed and released in November. This project is funded as part of Creative Scotland’s ’20 For 14′  scheme and is part of Culture 2014.</p>
