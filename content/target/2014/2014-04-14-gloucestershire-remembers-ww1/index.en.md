<p>This is a joint partnership project between the Everyman Theatre; Gloucestershire Archives; the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum; Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum and The History Press (the UK's largest specialist history publishers). The project will run from August 2013 to December 2015 and will enhance the heritage of Gloucestershire in relation to the Great War. The project will give local communities an opportunity to explore and learn from the rich WWI collections in Gloucestershire. From the extensive records at Gloucestershire Archives, to the regimental records of Gloucestershire soldiers at the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, to the social history and visual art collections at Cheltenham Art Gallery. The project will also focus on the heritage of local communities using war memorials as a foundation for community and volunteer participation. The Everyman will use the creative arts to engage people in their heritage using partners' collections and the project's research as inspiration.</p>
