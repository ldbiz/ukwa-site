<p>The King’s Cross Development Forum was set up in 2002 by the Planning Department at the London Borough of Camden in association with the London Borough of Islington. The Forum helps people living and working in King’s Cross to have a say in the future of the area and the development of the old railway lands (now known as “King’s Cross Central”). It consists of member organisation volunteers and individuals from the local communities.</p>
