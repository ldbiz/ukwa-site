The Japanese Railway Society (JRS) was founded in 1991 in London to promote the knowledge of the 
railways of Japan in the UK & other non-Japanese-speaking parts of the world. Since 1991, there have 
been several activities like exhibitions (also of railway models), a TV-show (on Naruhodo The World, Fuji TV), 
many meetings in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and many guided tours to and meetings in Japan.
