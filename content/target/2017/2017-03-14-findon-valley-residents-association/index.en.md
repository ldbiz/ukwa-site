Findon Valley is situated just north of Worthing, nestled at the foot of the South Downs, and close to Cissbury Ring. There are around 1900 households living in the valley, from all walks of life, with King's Parade as its 'hub' where you will find many shops, businesses and eateries. Within a few minutes' walk from the parade there is also a library, doctors' surgery, primary school and two churches.
