The Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep
and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic
and security cooperation. It will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive
agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the
Treaty. But the UK government  believes it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.
