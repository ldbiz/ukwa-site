The Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep
and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic
and security cooperation. It will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive

Treaty. But the UK government  believes it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.
