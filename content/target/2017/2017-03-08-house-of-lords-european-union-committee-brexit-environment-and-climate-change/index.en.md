Membership of the EU has had a fundamental impact on environmental legislation in the UK, and withdrawal from the EU will affect nearly every aspect of the UK’s environmental policy. In recent years, UK climate change policy has also become increasingly enmeshed in EU policy. EU environmental law includes such diverse areas as nature and biodiversity, waste and recycling and chemicals regulation, while the EU’s climate action measures include emissions trading, energy efficiency standards and support for low carbon technologies. Though the UK has strong domestic climate change legislation, domestic environment policy is heavily influenced by EU law. Brexit is an opportunity to amend or repeal existing legislative measures, but the environment, and those seeking to preserve or invest in it, need long-term policy stability. Maintaining this stability during the Brexit process will be crucial to ensure that legal protections for the UK’s environment remain complete and effective.
