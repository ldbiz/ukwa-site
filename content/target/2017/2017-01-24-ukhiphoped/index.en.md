#HipHopEd is an approach to education and youth development that is rooted in identifying and building upon the intellectual abilities exemplified within Hip-Hop music and pedagogy. We are committed as educators to work for the continued improvement of the educational experiences of our youth. We are intentional in our efforts to contemplate, evaluate and contribute to Hip-Hop culture through education.
