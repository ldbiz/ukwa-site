Saqi Books is an independent publishing house of quality general interest and academic books on North Africa and the Middle East. Founded in 1983 in London, Saqiâ€™s links with cutting edge and authoritative voices have led to a rigorous reassessment of Arab cultural heritage. Over the years Saqi has expanded its list to include writers from all over the world and has established two imprints, Telegram and The Westbourne Press.
