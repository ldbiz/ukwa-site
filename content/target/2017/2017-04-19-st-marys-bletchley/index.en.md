St Mary's Church stands on the site of the original Norman Church. This church was probably square, with narrow windows, red & gold painted walls, a rush matting floor and possibly a single wooden bench for the elderly or infirm. All that now remains of the original church is the South Doorway, which now serves as the main entrance to our church and which was moved to its current location early in the 14th century.
