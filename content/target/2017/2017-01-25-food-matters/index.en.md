Food Matters is a not-for-private-profit, national food policy and advocacy organisation. They encourage and support change towards sustainable, fair food systems. We all have our parts to play in taking action to create change within our food system, from communities, third-sector organisations and business through to local and national government. To support this change, Food Matters has developed an innovative, participatory, whole-food-systems approach to establishing healthy, sustainable, fair food as the norm.
