Anarchist Teapot are an anarchist collective that cooks at events which they want to support. They are predominantly based in Brighton but have cooked at events all over the country. They cook affordable, vegan, GM-free and mostly organic food. They don't aim to make profits. Anarchist Teapot formed out of a series of squatted cafes around Brighton, and have had a mobile kitchen since 1998.
