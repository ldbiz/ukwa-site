According to the site, 'In circa 1552 Elis Gruffudd completed his massive chronicle of the history of the world, which was then divided in two. In the first part, NLW Manuscript 5276D he attempts to describe the world's history in six ages from it's Creation through to the Christian Age. In the second part, NLW Manuscript 3054D we are told the history of England and Wales from the time of William the Conqueror to 1552. The chronicle was the last work which he ever created'. The book has been digitised by the National Library of Wales.
