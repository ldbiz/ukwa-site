Ubele (derived from the Swahili mbele meaning The Future) is an inter-generational community building initiative, formed in May 2011, which focuses on the African Diaspora community in the UK. It aims to increase our communityâ€™s capacity to lead, community build and  create innovative and entrepreneurial social responses to some of our most stuck social issues.
