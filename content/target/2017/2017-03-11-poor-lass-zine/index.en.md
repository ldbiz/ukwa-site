"Weâ€™re two working class northern lasses who wanna tell our OWN stories, with our OWN voices, in our OWN accents and dialogues and at our OWN academic levels.  We want to give people like us a voice that is so often unheard and encourage other working class folks out there and empower them. To tell and share our stories, to smash stereotypes and pre-conceived ideas."   Site includes online versions of earlier issues of Poor Lass Zine.
