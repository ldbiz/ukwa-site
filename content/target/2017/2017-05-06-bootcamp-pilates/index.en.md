Bootcamp Pilates is Londonâ€™s original and best reformer Pilates method, honed, perfected and practiced since 2005 using state of the art equipment in beautiful studios. Elite trainers deliver an hour-long session that not only tones to produce a lean and strong silhouette, but also is great for rehabilitation, post-natal conditioning, weight loss, alignment and strength gain.
