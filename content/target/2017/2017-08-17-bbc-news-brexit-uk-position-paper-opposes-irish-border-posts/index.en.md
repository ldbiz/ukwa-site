The government said there must be an "unprecedented solution" for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. .A position paper detailing its proposals stresses the need to avoid a hard border. The government says there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border. It also does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border or set back from it. Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized enterprises will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.
