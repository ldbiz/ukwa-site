This Report looks at the ways in which the system by which the House of Commons scrutinises EU legislation may need to be reshaped in the light of the referendum result and of the negotiations for UK withdrawal from the European Union. It has been prepared in the lead up to the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday 29 March 2017. The European Union is not standing still while the UK negotiates Brexit. Legislation and policy continue to be developed and to progress through the system. Whether or not changes at EU level involve the UK directly, they may make a significant difference to the context of negotiations. In negotiating exit, the UK Government needs to be alert to the negotiations on current business; it cannot start from the assumption that EU policy and legal frameworks are fixed. Rather than driving away from a fixed petrol pump, Brexit is analogous to disengaging from mid-air refuelling. Both parties are moving; the challenge is to separate them without either losing momentum.
