The Prime Minister informed Parliament that on  Friday December 8th  the Government and the European Commission published a joint report on progress during the first phase of the Brexit negotiations. On the basis of this report and following the discussions held throughout the week, President Juncker would recommend  to the European Council that sufficient progress had been made to move to the next stage and begin talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. President Tusk responded positively by proposing guidelines for the next phase of the negotiations.
