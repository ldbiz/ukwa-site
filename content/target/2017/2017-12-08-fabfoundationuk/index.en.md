Fab Foundation UK exists to inform, advise, support and help raise donations for supplementary/replacement
equipment for new and existing FabLabs in the UK. The Foundation provides training opportunities and support
to groups, individuals and organisations wishing to set up their own FabLab. It also supplies ongoing advice
for its Associate Members and will act as the centre for sharing of information amongst them online.
