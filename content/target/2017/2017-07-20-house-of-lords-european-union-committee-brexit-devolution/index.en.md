The impact of UK withdrawal from the EU on the UKâ€™s devolution settlements is one of the most technically complex and politically contentious elements of the Brexit debate. The devolution settlements have developed incrementally and asymmetrically since 1997, as more overlapping and shared competences have been introduced. Moreover, EU law is interwoven with the devolution settlements, and throughout this period, the supremacy of that EU law, and its interpretation by the Court of Justice of the EU, have helped to hold the UK together and maintain the integrity of its internal market. Brexit thus presents fundamental constitutional challenges to the United Kingdom as a whole.
