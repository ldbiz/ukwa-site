Site of a funding charity, established with an endowment from the Big Lottery Fund in the wake of the 2012 London Olympics - the charity funds partners across the UK that provide opportunities in sports, physical activity, arts and culture, volunteering and social action. It was founded to continue and recreate the spirit of pride, positivity and social connectedness that people experienced during the London 2012 Games and we invest to create good outcomes for people and their communities.
