Swifts are with us for just three months each Summer, bringing spectacular action, drama and excitement to our urban skies.

These amazing birds have shared our buildings ever since the Romans came to Britain. They still breed in our eaves and gables, but not for much longer, as modern and renovated buildings exclude them.
