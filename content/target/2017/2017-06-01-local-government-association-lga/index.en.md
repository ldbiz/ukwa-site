The Local Government Association (LGA), previously known as 'Local Government Portal - Local Authorities' Gateway to National Support', is the national voice of local government. They work with councils to support, promote and improve local government. They are a politically-led, cross-party organisation that works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government. They aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
