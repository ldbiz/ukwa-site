Site of an initiative that aims to highlight the problems of dereliction in cities and emptiness in the countryside that flow from an elitist system of land ownership that allows a handful of individuals, quangos, insurance companies and trusts based in offshore tax havens to dictate the price, availability and use of land in Scotland - a joint initiative of Common Weal, Women for Independence, Scottish Land Action Movement, Radical Independence and land reform campaigners Andy Wightman MSP & Lesley Riddoch.
