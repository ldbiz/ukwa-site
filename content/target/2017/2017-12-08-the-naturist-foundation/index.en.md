The Naturist Foundation is the successor to the North Kent Sun Club, founded near Dartford in 1948. North Kent Sun Club moved to Brocken Hurst in the winter of 1958/59, and in 1976 The Naturist Foundation became a registered charity. The basic facilities having been installed by the building contractors who bought the original site. The majority of all the other facilities and services from which we benefit today have been created by the voluntary efforts of our contributors, which is still vitally important to our progress.
