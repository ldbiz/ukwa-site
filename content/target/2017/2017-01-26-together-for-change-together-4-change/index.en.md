Together 4 Change aims to be a key catalyst in bringing about improvements in the lives of people who have social or health needs. The members of our online communities constantly share what is happening to them. We work together with our members and others to try and improve things by providing a space for mutual support and by developing projects from the things we learn on these networks and advocating for policy and practice changes.
