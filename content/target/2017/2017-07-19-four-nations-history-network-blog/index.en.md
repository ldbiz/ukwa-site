The aim of the Four Nations History Network is to connect researchers working on the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The guest bloggers on the site offer their thoughts on the applicability of four nations approaches to their research. The network's co-founders are Naomi Lloyd-Jones and Margaret Scull, History PhD students at Kingâ€™s College London. The Network is partnered with leading organisations and institutions.
