The website is the centrepiece of ambitious plans to widen awareness among the general public. A long-running programme of exhibitions, events and activities is taking place across the country alongside a scheme to encourage the study of Jainism in schools. This is supported by an online resource for teachers. These plans should help spark interest in a little-known religion among people of all backgrounds as well as enhance all Jainsâ€™ knowledge of their heritage. The JAINpedia project was created by the Institute of Jainology (IoJ) after the successful 2006 publication of the Catalogue of the Jain Collection at the British Library. Launched at Buckingham Palace by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, the book was co-authored by Professor Nalini Balbir.
The IoJ conceived the JAINpedia project in 2007 with the vision of making the Jain collections in major UK institutions more accessible to the public
