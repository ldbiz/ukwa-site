The Worshipful Company of Woolmen is one of the oldest of the Livery Companies of the City of London tracing its roots to 1180.  Originally it was the body that oversaw woolpackers and wool merchants to ensure consistent standards for wool producers and wool merchants throughout the wool industry. It now combines its ancient history and traditions with an active role with the $80Bn Global Wool Pipeline Industries through its City Wool Project linking the City of London Financial and Professional sectors with the Global Industry.  Equally importantly through its Charitable Trust  it  supports research into appropriate wool related procedures and practices; provides bursaries for students of wool, textile, design, wool marketing and retailing and it awards prizes and medals for sheep shearing at the major agricultural shows.
