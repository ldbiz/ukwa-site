We are a group of trade unionists from the NUT, PCS, Unison, Unite and UCU who called a national convention to discuss the coordinated strike action which took place on 30 November 2011. The conference brought together trade union activists, anti-cuts campaigners, young people, students and pensioners in order to build the widest possible support for the strikes. Since then we have organised a number of conferences and strive to organise solidarity for those fighting back against austerity.
