The Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel exists to support and promote policies which lead to peace and security for Israel in the context of a comprehensive and lasting Middle East peace settlement. They are committed to a two state solution, with Israel living in secure borders, free from the threat of terrorism, alongside an independent Palestinian State.
