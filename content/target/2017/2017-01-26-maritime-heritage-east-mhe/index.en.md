Maritime Heritage East (MHE) is a programme running across the East of England working with more than 30 museums and heritage organisations, whose goal is to establish and develop the position and importance of maritime history, both within the region and nationally. The programme was originally created by Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service with funding from a range of organisations. Today it is funded by the members together with an annual grant from SHARE. It is now managed by the members themselves through a management team.
