Theresa May insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the government published new details of its position, the PM said the UK would "take back control of our laws". But critics said it would be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU.
