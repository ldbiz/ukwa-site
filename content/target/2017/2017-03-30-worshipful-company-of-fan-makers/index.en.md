City Livery Companies have been active in London for over a millennium with their origins in the Guilds that developed all over Europe. Early companies set wages, controlled standards and checked quality as well as training apprentices and controlling imports.

Early records of the Fan Makers have been lost but it is known that a Guild of Fannmakers existed during the reign of Charles II as evidenced by their petition to Parliament in 1670 concerning the threat from the importation of foreign fans. Parliament responded by imposing a duty on imported fans in 1672.
