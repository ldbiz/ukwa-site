This is Rubbish aims to communicate the preventable scale of food wasted in the UK, through policy research, community and arts led public events. Formed in 2009 by volunteers, TiR registered as a Community Interest Company in 2011. The organisation now has an extensive portfolio of successful events through England and Wales.
