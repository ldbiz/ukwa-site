The Zero Suicide Alliance is a collaborative of National Health Service Trusts, Businesses and Individuals who are all committed to suicide prevention in the UK and beyond. The alliance is ultimately concerned with improving support for people contemplating suicide by raising awareness of and promoting FREE suicide prevention training which is accessible to all. The aims of this training are to; enable people to identify when someone is presenting with suicidal thoughts/ behaviour, to be able to speak out in a supportive manner, and to empower them to signpost the individual to the correct services or support.
