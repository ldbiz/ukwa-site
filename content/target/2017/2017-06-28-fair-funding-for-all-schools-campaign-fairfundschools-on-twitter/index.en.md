Twitter account of the Fair Funding in Schools Campaign. Schools in England are facing the biggest cuts in a generation due to a new government funding formula, for which no-one voted.The money following children into school is going down, leading to increased class sizes, loss of teaching and support staff, fewer resources and out-of-school activities and fewer subject choices. This parent-led group is campaigning against the new funding formula.
