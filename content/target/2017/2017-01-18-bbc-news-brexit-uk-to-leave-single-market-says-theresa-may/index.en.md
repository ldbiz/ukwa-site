Theresa May said in her speech on January 17th 2017 that the UK "cannot possibly" remain within the European single market, as staying in it would mean "not leaving the EU at all". The PM promised to push for the "freest possible trade" with European countries and warned the EU that to try to "punish" the UK would be "an act of calamitous self-harm".

She also said Parliament would vote on the final deal that is agreed.
