Accroding to the site, 'This exhibition is a little window into the everyday life of people in Wales. It is not intended to show all aspects of work and leisure but to illustrate those subjects represented in the collections of the National Library of Wales and Carmarthen Museum. There are several themes which interlock: working with heavy metals, coal mining, both activities now much reduced and almost extinct in parts of Wales. The leisure pictures include images of play, sport and enjoying the outdoors in picnics and the seaside. The play pictures also show some more serious pursuits such as worship, poem-making and protesting'.
