This 14th Century building was once home to the Almoner of the Benedictine Abbey that was founded at Evesham in the 8th Century.

Following the closure of the Abbey by Henry VIII, the Almonry became the personal home of the last Abbot, Philip Ballard, whilst the rest of the Abbey buildings were sold to Sir Philip Hoby who arranged for the quarrying of the stone.
