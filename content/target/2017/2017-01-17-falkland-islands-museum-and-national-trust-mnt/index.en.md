The M&NT was established by Ordinance in 1991, although the Museum itself had operated in various forms for many years, often run only by volunteers. The Trust was created to ensure that the fragile and fast-disappearing heritage of the Islands was protected, recorded and collected in a manner which was both funded and regulated.
