Website of the Grenfell Action Group, a community action group in North Kensington, London. About: The Grenfell Action Group was formed in 2010 to oppose the Kensington Academy and Leisure Centre development which we considered, and still consider, to be a gross overdevelopment of an inappropriate site that would involve the destruction of Lancaster Green, one of the few local green spaces, and the only residential amenity space available for the residents of the immediately adjacent Grenfell Tower.  We were, and still are, committed to defending the rights of the residents of Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling, inner-city, social housing complex of nearly a thousand dwellings, mostly working class, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic. Our community is located in North Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Our blog has recorded, and continues to record, our struggle and we hope will remain as evidence for future generations of how our community has been mis-treated by RBKC and its social housing management agents the Kensington & Chelsea TMO (KCTMO).
