Founded in London in 2011, the National Algerian Centre is a charitable incorporated organisation registered in England and Wales. It is dedicated to building a social cohesive community whereby everyone feels included. Among its projects is 'the Big Dinner' which has taken place annually during the holy month of Ramadan since 2013, offering a community meal to which everyone is invited every evening for 30 days.
