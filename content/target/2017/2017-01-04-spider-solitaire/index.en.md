Although Spider Solitaire hasnâ€™t been around as long as the other varieties, it still has some history. The game got its name because a spider has eight legs and there are 8 discard piles that have to be filled and it is also true that the game is based on a similar Solitaire game called Scorpion. This game originated in 1949 and became a popular variety among players of Solitaire.
