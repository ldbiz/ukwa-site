T2A (Transition to Adulthood) is an initiative of the Barrow Cadbury Trust’s criminal justice programme. The Trust is an independent, charitable foundation – which does not receive any government funding – committed to bringing about socially just change.

The Trust’s criminal justice programme aims to develop and promote evidence of effective policy and practice for young adults and women at all stages of the criminal justice system, and  to enable the voices of those directly affected to be heard.
