From May 2016, a group of rail users and local campaigners came together to organise protests; initially at Brighton Station and London Victoria, and later the Department for Transport itself. With the success of these protests, the #SouthernFail campaign was born, along with our Facebook group the Association of British Commuters â€“ now the most active place of online discussion about the Southern Rail crisis.
