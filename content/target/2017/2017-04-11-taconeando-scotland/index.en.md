Taconeando Scotland is a travel blog written by a woman from Seville who has been living and travelling in Scotland for two years. She aims to connect with a larger community of Spanish expatriates who are now living abroad, and to document Scottish culture. The blog features original photography of Scottish landmarks and landscapes.
