Givey is the online donations platform serving the forgotten 95% of small charities, levelling the playing field and using the opportunity of mobile / social to reach new audiences. We highlight good news stories of people doing great work on the ground which is often £1 for £1 more effective and productive than large charities with huge overheads.
