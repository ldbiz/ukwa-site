The National Association of Nigerian Communities (NANC) is an organisation that has been in existence since the 1970s.
We started as a students union and when our pioneers ceased to be students, the union then metamorphosed into a welfare association called the NNU.
 
The name NNU was changed to NANC in July 2004 due to a need to be in tune with modern voluntary organisation operating philosophy.
 
Like any other organisation, NANC has had its ups and downs, but it has stood up to its challenges over time, achieving some notable milestones for Nigerians. NANC presently exists as a full welfare organisation, supporting the socio-cultural and education needs of Nigerians and Africans living in the UK.
