A rich history as the ancestral home of the Manners-Sutton family, along with its use as a theological college for an Anglican Order of Monks, and the distinct design features of renowned architect Sir George Gilbert Scott make Kelham Hall a fascinating place to discover.

The present Kelham Hall is the third building to have stood on the site with two former halls having been damaged significantly by fire (one in the early eighteenth century and a second in 1857). All three halls were built for the Manners Sutton family, whose links with Kelham and Averham date back to the 12th century.
