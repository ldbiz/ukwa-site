Staging China, an international practice-led research network with its hub in Leeds is a development from the project Performing China on the Global Stage. It brings together academics, research students and theatre practitioners to reinvigorate Chinese theatre as a practice-led/cross-disciplinary subject. It aims to influence academic institutions and individual researchers; and to impact on performing industries and the general public.
