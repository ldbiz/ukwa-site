Site of an ecumenical charitable trust providing opportunities to access the Scotland's living heritage of faith by assisting the "living" churches in membership to work together with others to make the Church the focus of the community; open their doors with a welcoming presence; tell the story of the building (however old or new), its purpose and heritage (artistic, architectural and historical); provide information and care for visitors, young and old.
