Our mission is to promote knowledge, awareness and enjoyment of Handel and his music to as wide a public audience as possible. We strive to inspire, educate and inform through the interpretation of the Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, where Handel lived and composed for 36 years, through live music performances, educational and outreach activities and collecting, exhibiting and interpreting objects related to Handelâ€™s life and works.
