Chagfood is one of a growing number of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes across the UK that directly connect consumers and the farmers who produce their food. CSA simply describes a model of subscription farming where customers commit to support a farm for an entire season by paying for their produce either up front or by monthly direct debit. From the farmer’s point of view this commitment provides a guaranteed market and allows us to farm in a more low-input ecological way. In return members have a direct connection to the people and the fields producing their food and the opportunity to get involved with how their food is produced.

At Chagfood, they offer our members a ‘share’ of the harvest over the entire growing season for a set price. CSA is about consumers & farmers sharing the rewards and the risks of farming between them.
