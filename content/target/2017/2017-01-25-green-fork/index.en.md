Green Fork seeks to give people access to healthy, fresh and great tasting food and supply in a way that is convenient. 

They strive to serve great food that is nutritious, fresh and where possible locally produced, whilst maintaining a ruthless food hygiene standard and will deliver direct to offices for maximum convenience, free of charge and using innovative ways that leaves no carbon footprint.

They deliver food to offices in both Exchange Quays and Salford Quays. We provide companies with great quality, fresh sandwiches, Lunch Pots and smoothies. All of their food is made fresh the same morning and is designed to be healthy, delicious and office friendly.

They have also recently opened their first deli bar located in Trafford Park, Manchester.
