Lea Sautin is a printer and painter from Llanbedrog. Her 'artistic practice explores the themes of language, translation and perpetual transformation within the storytelling tradition of Wales. I am fascinated by the evolution of the ancient tales of the Mabinogion, from their fluid oral and performative origins to a fixed written manuscript, eventually leading to illustrations of the tales told in their own unique visual language'.
