The Migration Museum Project is increasing knowledge and appreciation of how migration has shaped Britain across the ages through the creation of an authoritative and inspiring permanent national Migration Museum, a far-reaching national education programme, and a knowledge-sharing network of museums and galleries across the UK. Since 2013, we have staged an acclaimed series of events, exhibitions and education workshops at a wide range of venues across the UK, shedding light on the lively part that migration plays in the national life, and helping us to hone our strategy and receive input and feedback from individuals and communities as we work towards our goals. Our exhibitions and events have been attended by over 100,000 visitors, while more than 3,500 school children have participated in our education workshops.
