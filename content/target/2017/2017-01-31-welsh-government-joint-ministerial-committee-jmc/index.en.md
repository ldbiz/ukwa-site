The Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) was established in 1999 and is a 'forum which includes the UK government and the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It enables the leaders of the 4 governments to examine matters of common interest and review the workings of devolution.... [and is] a platform for ministers to seek to resolve differences, disagreements and disputes between the administrations'.
