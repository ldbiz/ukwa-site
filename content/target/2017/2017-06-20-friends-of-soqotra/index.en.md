The Friends of Soqotra association (FOS) is a registered charity established to promote the sustainable use and conservation of the natural environment of the Soqotra Archipelago, and to support sustainable improvement in the standard of living of the people of the Soqotra Archipelago.
FOS is based in Great Britain but has members from many different European countries, the Middle East, Africa and America. The group was formed in 2001 in order to bring together people with a scientific background and those with a more general interest in the Archipelago of Soqotra. This website provides information about ongoing scientific research on the UNESCO World Heritage Site Soqotra, including data, a bibliography and contact details for institutions and research teams.
