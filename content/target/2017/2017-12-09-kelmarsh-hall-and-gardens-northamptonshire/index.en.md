Kelmarsh Hall is a Grade I listed country house built in 1732. The Kelmarsh Estate is now in the care of a charitable trust, charged with maintaining it in perpetuity for the benefit of the nation. In 2004, Kelmarsh Events Limited was set up as a commercial arm of the business to support the Charitable Trust.
