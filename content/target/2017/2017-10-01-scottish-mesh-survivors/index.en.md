Campaign against vaginal mesh implants. Before they knew each other, Elaine Holmes and Olive McIlroy were struggling to come to terms with constant pain and crippling side effects of a surgery that was supposed to 'change their lives'. Today they are the best of friends, two women united in a common aim, to ensure no other woman is put at risk from the polypropylene mesh implants which have devastated hundreds of thousands of lives across the world.
