Hartridge Monastery is a sanctuary in rural Devon, comprising 22 acres of land with a pond and new woodland, and accommodation based around an old farmhouse. The monastery is the residence for a small community of monks and novices practising in the Theravada tradition. The monks live as alms-mendicants, following a discipline based on guidelines established by the Buddha.
