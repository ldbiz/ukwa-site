The Yemeni Community Association (YCA) in Greater Manchester exists to help and support people whose family origins are in the Yemen or who hail from a BME background.

We do this by providing access to education, training, leisure and recreation opportunities. We also care for those within our community suffering from sickness, poverty or distress, and organise activities to preserve and promote the Yemeni language and culture. The YCA is based in the heart of Eccles (Salford) where the majority of Yemenis in Manchester live. There are more than 700 Yemeni families in Greater Manchester, most of whom are proud members of the YCA, and make use of its services daily.
