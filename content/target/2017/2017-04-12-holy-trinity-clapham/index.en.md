Holy Trinity Clapham opened for worship in 1776. The church is most famously associated with William Wilberforce and the group of friends known to history as “the Clapham Sect”. They lived around Clapham Common and worshipped in this church as they campaigned for the abolition of the slave trade and the spiritual and moral reformation of the nation.
