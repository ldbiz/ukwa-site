The Brookside Theatre is a self-funded and voluntarily run 140-seat theatre in the London Borough of Havering. Based within the Romford War Memorial buildings, it was established in 2012 and plays host to musicals, plays, live music, stand-up comedy, tribute acts and celebrity guests. The theatre aims to raise funds for the continued renovation of these historic buildings and also provides arts educational programs.
