The Legacy of Longfields is a heritage lottery funded project and examines the heritage of Longfields Association, a pioneering disability charity, established in 1952 by parents of children with cerebral palsy for whom there was no provision for education.
The site recognises the part that Longfields played in the social history of Swansea.
