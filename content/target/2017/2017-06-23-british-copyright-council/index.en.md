The British Copyright Council was founded in 1965 to protect and promote the principles of copyright in the UK.

Founded in 1965 and incorporated in 2007, the British Copyright Council is a not-for-profit organisation that provides a forum for discussion of copyright law and related issues at UK, European and International levels. The BCC is independent, receives no government funding and is the only organisation of its kind in the UK.
