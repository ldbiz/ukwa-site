The Design History Society is the leading organisation that promotes the study of global design histories, and brings together and supports all those engaged in the subject - students, researchers, educators, designers, designer-makers, critics and curators. The Society aims to play an important role in shaping an inclusive design history. Founded in 1977, the Design History Society works internationally to promote and support the study and understanding of design history.
