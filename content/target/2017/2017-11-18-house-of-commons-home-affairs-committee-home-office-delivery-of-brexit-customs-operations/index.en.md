This report on customs is the first stage in an overarching inquiry on the impact of Brexit on the EU. It looks at the possible operational challenges, particularly for the Home Office, the risks that need to be addressed and the additional contingency planning that needs to be done. While the Government has indicated that the UK will leave the EU customs union after Brexit, the Prime Minister has stated that she still wants the UK “to have a customs agreement with the EU”, although it is not yet clear what this will mean in practice. The practical challenge involved in changing customs and border arrangements is significant and potentially costly: imports and exports are worth billions of pounds and involve a vast number of businesses and intermediaries. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has estimated that Brexit could lead to an increase of up to 360% in the annual number of customs declarations in the UK, from the current total of 55 million to 255 million, if the arrangements after Brexit require declarations for UK trade with EU countries; and more than double the current number of traders may have to go through customs processes.
