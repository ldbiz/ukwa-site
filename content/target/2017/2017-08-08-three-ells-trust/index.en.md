The Three Ells Trust was formed in 2000 by David and Helen Naerger following the loss of their son, Lewis, aged 16 years from an Osteosarcoma (Primary Bone Tumour). In September 2014, their son, Lloyd, came on-board. He became a trustee shortly after, following the sad loss of David after a short battle with Renal Cell Carcinoma. Helen and Lloyd, along with support from his brother Liam, have continued the fantastic work that David was so passionate about.

The charity was set-up to make a difference to the lives of children, and their families, who have cancer or other life-limiting or life-threatening illnesses
