WE's mission is to ensure that women and girls have free access to as many resources as possible in order to both help them make confident decisions about their economic future and to become well-informed about the economy of the 21st century; an economy which, we believe, is increasingly female driven. The Women’s Economy is a brand of the Women’s Business Development Agency (WBDA), an internationally recognized women’s enterprise organisation which for the last 22 years, has helped women across Europe to start and grow their businesses.
