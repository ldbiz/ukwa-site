Walk-in Access Wales is a pilot project to enable members of the public to access e-resources in Welsh HE libraries. The Walk-in Access Wales project was completed in March 2013 with the publication of the Walk-in Access Wales Toolkit. The Walk-in Access Wales Toolkit is funded by CyMAL: Museums Archives Libraries Wales.
