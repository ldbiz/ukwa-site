Personal site of Iesha Small. "I mainly write about education, leadership and society. Occasionally creativity and other things may get a mention.

I teach maths and work as an Assistant Head teacher in a secondary school in England. I work with others within and beyond my organisation to spread my leadership philosophy that listening and asking the right questions  matters more than having all the right answers."
