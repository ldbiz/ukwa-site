Back in 1905, the Pendlebury Gospel Hall was erected on a site next to where Pendlebury Post office now stands. It represented an initiative of a group of Christians who were passionate about the need to preach the life transforming message of the gospel of Jesus Christ and rely totally on the bible as its sole authority.
