The Mental Health Forum has grown out of the 1 in 4 Forum, which was started by the Mental Health Foundation in the UK in April 2003. The 1 in 4 Forum earned a reputation of being a high-quality forum where members could get mutual support while also considering mental health policy and service development issues. In December 2007 the name of the 1 in 4 Forum was changed to the Mental Health Forum, and it became the web based forum it is today.
