The United Kingdom has made good progress in bringing down carbon emissions cost-effectively, cutting UK air pollution and opening up new growth in clean industries. The current governmentâ€™s legal endorsement of the Fifth Carbon Budget is a welcome milestone on the way to meeting our 2050 emissions reduction obligations under the Climate Change Act. The next government should continue with this success, and implement new policy to give investors the confidence to continue to boost clean growth.
