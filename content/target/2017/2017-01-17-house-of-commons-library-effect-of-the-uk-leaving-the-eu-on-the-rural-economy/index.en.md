This pack was produced ahead of the Opposition Day debate  held in the Commons Chamber on Tuesday 17 January 2017 on the effect of the UK leaving the EU on the rural economy. The debate was on the motion put forward by the Scottish National Party : That this House is concerned at the possible impact upon the rural economy of the Governmentâ€™s aim for the UK to leave the EU; and calls upon the Government to present to Parliament a clear statement of its aims for the rural economy in negotiations with the EU prior to triggering Article 50, and to give assurances on the future of agriculture, particularly with regard to funding, and fisheries after 2020.
