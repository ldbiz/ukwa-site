This is an attempt to discover, identify and understand sites that relate to either the military or civil response to war across Wales. In order to do this, the Council for British Archaeology has developed an online recording toolkit and guidance to help you record First World War remains. Cadw, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and the Welsh Archaeological Trusts are all co-ordinating a range of activities and events relating to the First World War.
