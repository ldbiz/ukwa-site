Free Your Mind is a Child Domestic Violence and Mental Heath support, awareness and support service.

Domestic Violence and Mental Illness is a major problem of our time; one that impacts on all aspects of a personâ€™s life.

1 in 3 children will have a mental illness as a direct result of family violence in their home.

1.8 million are effected across the UK.

1 billion children are effected globally. Here at Free Your Mind we are determined to redress this problem by providing the tools, support and community to help people rebuild their sense of self, and to empower them by teaching and advocating self-care and helping them to share their experience.
