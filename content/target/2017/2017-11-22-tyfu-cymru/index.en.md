Tyfu Cymru will work with supply chain partners and prepare growers and producer owned horticulture companies across Wales to adapt to future environmental challenges and position them to capitalise on market opportunities for business development and growth. The project is led by Lantra in collaboration with Planed, Puffin, Glyndwr and ADAS, with funding from the Welsh Government Cooperation and Supply Chain Development Scheme.
