THE BRITISH SHALOM-SALAAM TRUST was established in 2004 by a group of Jews in response to the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East caused by the Israeli Occupation. It welcomes supporters of all faiths and none. The Trust aims to foster positive relations between Jews, Palestinians and other communities living within Israelâ€™s 1967 borders, in the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan; and as refugees in other parts of the Middle East.
