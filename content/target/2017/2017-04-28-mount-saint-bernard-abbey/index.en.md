Mount Saint Bernard Abbey was founded in 1835 on land provided by Ambrose de Lisle, who was eager to re-introduce monastic life into this country. It was on Michaelmas day of that year that Br Augustine Higgs took possession of the half-ruined cottage in Tin Meadon. He was soon joined by other monks: Luke, Xavier, Cyprian, Placid and Simeon. Their leader, Fr Odilo Woolfrey, wrote: ‘Here we are. I with my little company, already established in a little cottage on this land in Charnwood Forest which we have named “Mount Saint Bernard.”‘ The monks soon set about cultivating the wild and barren land and the first monastery was opened in 1837, designed by William Railton.
