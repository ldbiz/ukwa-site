Worldwide Shopping Guide is a website dedicated to travel and shopping, and the point where the two intersect. Shopping is a big part of travel, whether itâ€™s the essential pre-trip purchase of a new rucksack or suitcase, buying a new camera on the road because your old one gave up, or specifically travelling to a new destination to buy a product that comes from there (spices in India, watches in Switzerland, or shoes in Italy, for example).
