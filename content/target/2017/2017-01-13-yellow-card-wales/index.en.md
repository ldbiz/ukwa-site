Yellow Card Wales is based at the All Wales Therapeutics and Toxicology Centre at University Hospital Llandough. The Yellow Card Scheme is run by the MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and is used to collect information from both health professionals and the general public on suspected side effects or ADRs to medicines and vaccines.
