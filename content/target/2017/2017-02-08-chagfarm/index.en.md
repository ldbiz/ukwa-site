Chagfarm (Chagford Community Farm CIC) aims to make the local community's food supply more resilient by working closely with Chagfood, another local food enterprise, and complementing their existing vegetable subscription offer. They do this by offering local goat dairy products and honey, as well as high-welfare goat meat, pork, organic woodland poultry, lamb, beef, venison and game.

They operate on a payment by subscription basis, meaning customers sign up as members and commit to buying a certain amount of produce over a period of at least a year.

Their mission is to develop a thriving local economy by supporting existing producers and retailers, including working with local butchers and offering produce from other farms.
