The London Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) group was established during the minersâ€™ strike of 1984-5. The alliance between LGSM and the South Wales striking miners was a significant factor in turning the tide in the trade union movement in favour of equality measures for lesbians and gay men.
