Russia's Great War and Revolution is a decade-long multinational scholarly effort that aims to transform understanding of Russia's "continuum of crisis" during the years 1914-1922. The project incorporates new research methods, archival sources, and multiple media formats to re-conceptualize critical concepts and events and to increase public awareness of RussiaÂ¹s contributions to the history of the twentieth century.
