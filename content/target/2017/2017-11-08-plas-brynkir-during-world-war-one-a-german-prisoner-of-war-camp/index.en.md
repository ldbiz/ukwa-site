Brynkir is an abandoned estate in Dolbenmaen, near to the town of Porthmadog. The Brynkir estate has a rich history dating back to when it was Llewelyn the Greatâ€™s deer park in the thirteenth century, and later, a great estate for the Brynker family, one of the most influential families in North Wales.
