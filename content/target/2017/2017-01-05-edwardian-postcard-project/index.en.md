The early British postcard is a multimodal communications technology. In the heyday of the postcard during the Edwardian age (1901-1910), it offered an opportunity for the exchange of everyday messages with pictures at very low cost. This opportunity was not to be available again until the contemporary digital revolution. This site now features a searchable resource of 1,000 postcards, together with their transcriptions. They've added historical records wherever we've been able to find additional historical information.
