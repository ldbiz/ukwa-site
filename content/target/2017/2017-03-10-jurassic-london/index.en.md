Jurassic London was founded by Anne C Perry and Jared Shurin in 2011, and their first anthology, Stories of the Apocalypse was published that year to coincide with an exhibition at Tate Britain. 

Jurassic London closed in October 2016, following the publication of The Extinction Event. 

During its five year run,  Jurassic London published over four dozen titles, including fiction, contemporary non-fiction, chapbooks featuring new authors, and luxury editions of both new and classic works.

Their goal was to showcase the continued relevance, creativity and fun to be found in literature, especially genre fiction. Since their original publication with Tate Britain, they worked alongside partners such as English PEN, the Egypt Exploration Society, the Royal Observatory Greenwich and the National Maritime Museum.
