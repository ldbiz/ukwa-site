The origins of the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths are lost in time. It is known that from the 1300â€™s to the Reformation, the Company was known as a Fraternity having strong religious connotations. The Patron Saint of the Fraternity was St. Loie who is a French Saint from the Limoges region and today is the Patron Saint of the Blacksmiths (he is sometimes referred to as St. Eloye or St. Loije but in Latin he is referred to as St. Eligius).
