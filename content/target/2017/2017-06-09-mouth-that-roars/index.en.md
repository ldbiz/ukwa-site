Mouth That Roars (MTR) is Youth Media Organisation which was set up with the sole purpose of training young people in film production who wouldn’t ordinarily have access to media resources. MTR enables young people who are quite often misrepresented, a space to be heard and a medium in which they can voice their thoughts and feelings. Good youth work and children’s rights practice underpins MTR’s approach
