The Foyer Federation was established in 1992, alongside the first five Foyers. Since then, the Foyer network has grown rapidly and now operates in over 120 urban and rural communities across the UK, providing safe, quality assured environments, where experts reconnect up to 10,000 young people each year with personal development opportunities.
