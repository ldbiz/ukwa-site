Afterall is a Research Centre of University of the Arts London, located at Central Saint Martins. Founded in 1998 by Charles Esche and Mark Lewis, Afterall focuses on contemporary art and its relation to a wider artistic, theoretical and social context.  Afterall, a journal of art, context and enquiry, was launched in 1999. Afterall offers in-depth analysis of artistsâ€™ work, along with essays that broaden the context in which to understand it.
