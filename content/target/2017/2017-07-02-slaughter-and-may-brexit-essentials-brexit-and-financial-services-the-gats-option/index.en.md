This note considers the position if the UK is not be able to negotiate access to the EU Single Market and will instead rely on the rules of the WTO in order to trade with other EU/EEA Member States following withdrawal from the EU. The UK Government announced that it will seek to negotiate a preferential trade agreement with the EU, although as the shape of such an agreement is unclear, and might not be negotiated within the two years after notification under Article 50(2) TEU it is not considered here.
