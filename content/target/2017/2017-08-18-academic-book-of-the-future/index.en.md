The Academic Book of the Future was a two-year AHRC-funded research project exploring the future of the academic book.
Project activity ended in September 2016, however the legacy is ongoing â€“ including Academic Book Week. This website provides information about the project, its research outputs, and its other activities. The main project report is set to launch in late Spring 2017.
