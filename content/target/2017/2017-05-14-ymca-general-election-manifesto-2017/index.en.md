Contained within this manifesto are messages of change for the next government; not always ones which are easily achievable but ones which are necessary if we want to live in a society that truly supports and develops young people in our communities. One message that is absolutely clear is that YMCA today – like every other day for the past 173 years – stands ready, willing and able to deliver this change with government, society and young people.
