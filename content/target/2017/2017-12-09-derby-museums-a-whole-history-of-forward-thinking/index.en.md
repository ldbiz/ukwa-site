Derby Museums is a charitable trust, responsible for holding and curating all art and collections in our care. We are passionate about showcasing the best of Derby’s rich cultural and creative history in a fun and interactive way. Each of our sites is steeped in history: The Museum and Art Gallery, built partly in 1879 and home to a large collection of Joseph Wright paintings; The Silk Mill, on the site of the world’s first factory, and Pickford’s House, the gorgeous Georgian property of architect Joseph Pickford. There’s a whole range of unique and exciting exhibitions across the three sites waiting to be explored!
