Cartooning the Post-War World is a selection of newspaper cartoons of Joseph Morewood Staniforth (‘JMS’) which originally appeared in the News of the World and the Western Mail between the end of the First World War in November 1918 and the death of Staniforth in December 1921.The cartoons document the cartoonist’s response to the international and domestic situation as Wales, Britain, Europe and the wider world began to readjust to peacetime conditions. The Cartooning the Road to War is part of the Cartooning the First World War project, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and based at Cardiff University.
