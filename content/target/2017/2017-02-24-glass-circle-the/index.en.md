The Glass Circle was founded in 1937 by a small group of collectors interested in eighteenth century English drinking glasses. The society now includes over 300 members from at least 12 different countries including collectors, museum curators, academics, dealers and auctioneers. They host lectures in central London, organise occasional exhibitions and visits to places of glass interest, and publish the 'Glass Circle News' magazine and a scholarly journal. Current membersâ€™ interests range from Roman and earlier to contemporary glass.
