The Association of American Study Abroad Programmes United Kingdom (AASAP/UK) was established in 1991 to represent American study abroad programmes in the UK. It provides a forum for directors and administrative staff to discuss and respond to common issues in order to meet the needs of the present and anticipate the demands of the future. The Association is a member-focused and member-led organisation. It holds regular meetings on topics relevant to study abroad, keeps members abreast of news affecting the sector, and facilitates links between various institutions.
