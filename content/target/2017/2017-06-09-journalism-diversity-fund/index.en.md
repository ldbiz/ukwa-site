The Journalism Diversity Fund was set up in 2005 with a donation of Â£100,000 from the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA). It is supported by those in the industry who want to make newsrooms better reflect communities they serve by encouraging people from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds to train as journalists. The aim is to action real change and network with the talent and decision makers to ensure diversity is at the top of the agenda throughout our industry.
