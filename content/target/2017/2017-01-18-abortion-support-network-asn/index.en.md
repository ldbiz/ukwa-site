ASN is a charity that provides financial assistance, accommodation and confidential information to women forced to travel from Ireland and Northern Ireland and pay privately for abortions in England. The cost of this ranges from £400 to £2000 depending on circumstance and stage of pregnancy. ASN was founded with the understanding that making abortion against the law doesn’t stop abortion but only stops safe abortion.
