EEF was formed in 1896 as the Engineering Employers' Federation and merged in 1918 with the National Employers' Federation. In November 2003, EEF rebranded itself as 'EEF, the Manufacturers' Organisation'.

EEF also includes UK Steel, the trade association for the UK steel industry. This organisation represents the sectorâ€™s interests to government and champions this modern, vibrant and dynamic industry to the public. Through its network of regional offices in England, Wales and Brussels, EEF helps its thousands of member businesses to compete, innovate and grow through the provision of a range of services.
