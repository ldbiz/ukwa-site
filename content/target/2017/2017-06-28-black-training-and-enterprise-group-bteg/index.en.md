The Black Training and Enterprise Group was established in 1991 by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and a group of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) voluntary organisations. In 1996, BTEG registered as a charity. . BTEG plays a unique role by supporting BAME civil society organisations, providing a national voice and promoting equality, inclusion, collaboration and entrepreneurship in BAME communities. BTEG is a respected and resilient organisation and celebrates its 21st anniversary this year. "BTEGâ€™s mission is to end racial inequality. We believe that the contribution of all communities makes a nation, builds dynamic local communities, generates wealth and improves well-being. We champion fairness, challenge discrimination and pioneer innovative solutions to empower BAME communities through education, employment and enterprise. Our activities involve working with Government, business, public services, BAME organisations and the media."
