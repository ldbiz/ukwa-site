Your Brexit is a new blog that was set up with two goals in mind. It aims to be able to bring all of its followers the very latest developments in the long and winding road that will lead to the United Kingdomâ€™s eventual withdrawal from the European Union. Also, it intends to offer a platform for ordinary members of the public to voice their own opinions and concerns about the entire Brexit process.
