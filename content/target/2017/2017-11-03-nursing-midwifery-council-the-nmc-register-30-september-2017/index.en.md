Figures show that in 2017 more people were leaving the NMC's register than
were joining it. 35,363 people left the register between October 2016 and September 2017 and 27,786 joined it (27 percent more people leaving than joining). This decrease was driven in part by more people from the UK leaving the register than joining it. We also saw fewer people from the EEA joining the register and more people from the EEA leaving the register.
