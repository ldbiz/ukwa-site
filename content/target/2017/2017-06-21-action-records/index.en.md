Action Records has been established since 1979, starting off on a stall in Blackpool just as the independent music scene was emerging. From there we soon opened a site in Preston, where we have been ever since. We are members of all specialist independent chains; therefore we are offered all limited editions and special offers including quantity on all Record Store Day releases. We have always been at the forefront of music trends throughout the years, and we've also established our own record label, releasing records by bands such as The Boo Radleys, Dandelion Adventure, Big Red Bus, Genocides, Tompaulin, Fi-Lo Radio, Monkey Steals The Drum amongst others. Our biggest project so far has been with The Fall and Mark E Smith as a solo performer.
