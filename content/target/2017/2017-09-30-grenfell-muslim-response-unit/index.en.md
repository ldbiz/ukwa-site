The Grenfell Muslim Response Unit was set up by independent volunteers in response to the Grenfell Fire. The project, now hosted by the National Zakat Foundation continues to support families and victims through a range of service provisions. The Grenfell Muslim Response Unit serves all those affected, regardless of race, religion or creed.
