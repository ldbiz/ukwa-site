The Outdoor Recreation Network (ORN) was formerly the Countryside Recreation Network (CRN). ORN continues to be committed to exchanging and sharing information to develop best policy and practice in countryside recreation across the UK and Ireland. This is achieved through networking between our member organisations, organising research meetings, holding seminars and distributing the information to the wider audience through e-zines, a published journal and publications freely available on this website.
