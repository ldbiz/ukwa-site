MOJUK campaigns on behalf of victims of miscarriages of justice in the UK. "The Criminal Justice System has become the focal point of increased criticism over recent years due to a rising Prison population, unrest within the Prison System itself, deaths in custody, racism, and miscarriages of justice. There are in the UK prison system many hundreds of people who are convinced they should not be there. They claim they should not be there for no other reason than that they are victims of a ‘Miscarriage of Justice’. These victims of the Criminal Justice system commonly refer to themselves as ‘Hostages of the State’. MOJUK aims to keep an up to date record of all those ‘Hostages’, who are campaigning against a miscarriage of justice.
