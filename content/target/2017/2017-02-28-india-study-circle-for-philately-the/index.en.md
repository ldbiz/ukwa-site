The India Study Circle was formed in 1950 to keep permanent records and promote study and research into the philatelic and postal history of India. This includes material from Burma, Pakistan, Bangladesh and all the Princely States. They include British Indian Post Offices located outside India and the posts of other European powers that held ground within it.
As well as the issue and use of stamps and postal stationery they study postal markings, postal rates and routes. They also cover Military Postal History from wherever the Indian Army has operated and set up postal communications; and from the British Army in India.
