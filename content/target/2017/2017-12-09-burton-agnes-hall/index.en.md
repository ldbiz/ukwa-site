In 1977 Mr. Marcus Wickham-Boynton handed Burton Agnes Hall and gardens to a charitable trust formed for its protection and future upkeep. Under this arrangement it was hoped that future generations of the Boynton family would continue to live in it and it would therefore remain a 'lived-in' family home.
