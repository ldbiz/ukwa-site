The Malcolm X Movement is a Black & Asian led radical decolonial anti-imperialist movement in the heart of whiteness - London.The genesis of the MXM starts in June 2012. A network of around 30 activists mostly in their late 20s came together from a variety of different political backgrounds to plan launching the movement in 2015, the 50th anniversary of Malcolm Xâ€™s assassination.
