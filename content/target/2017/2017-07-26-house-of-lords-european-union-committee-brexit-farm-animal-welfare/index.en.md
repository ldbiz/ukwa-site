The UK has some of the highest farm animal welfare standards in the world. UK producers are rightly proud of these standards, and there is cross-sector support for maintaining high levels of farm animal welfare after Brexit. In order to deliver on its commitment to preserving these standards, the Government must transpose existing EU law on farm animal welfare into domestic law so as to be effective on day one after Brexit. Skilled veterinary staff on farms, in abattoirs and during transport play a key role in inspecting the health and wellbeing of animals. As the UK leaves the EU Single Market and customs union, the need for veterinary certification related to trade may rise significantly. Yet the UK agri-food sector relies heavily on workers from other EU countries, in particular as veterinary staff. The Government must therefore make sure the industry continues to have access to the staff and the skills that it needs to support good welfare and certify products for exports.
