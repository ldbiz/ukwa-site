Ben Gummer stood for re-election as Conservative MP for Ipswich at the 2017 general election but was not elected. He was first elected to serve in 2010 and has held the seat ever since. He wrote the Conservative's unpopular General Election manifesto, considered one of the causes of Mrs May's loss of her Commons majority.
