St. George's is a generously proportioned late 13th century church with a 15th century tower and porch.  It is a Grade I listed building.  The Church dominates the village square at the centre of Wrotham, a village of just under 800 households and some 2,500 inhabitants, lying on the Pilgrims Way.  St. George’s is the only place of worship in the village.  It is the second church to be built on the site – the first dating back to the middle of the 10th century - and has always been dedicated to St George, which was relatively rare at the time of its consecration.
