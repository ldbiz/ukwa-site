The website Art Exchange (formerly Art Collaboration) is an ever-growing online gallery and archive of all of Manuel Vasonâ€˜s collaborations; an answer to the unresolved dilemma of documenting a live performance; a presentation of work from some of the contemporary performance artists; and a collection of performances, devised for the camera.
