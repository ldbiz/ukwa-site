UKIP Daily aims to give a platform to all views within UKIP, so that they can be discussed in a sensible manner. We want the grassroots to have a say in shaping the future direction of the party; we aim to be a conduit through which their voice can be heard. We also invite people from industry, the media and from think tanks to offer their views in order to open dialogue with the party.
