SADACCA has been in operation for over 30 years and boasts a number of successes  in terms of the activities it provides to the community and the variety of groups using the facilities. Prior to 1986 it operated as the West Indian Association, an organisation formed in 1955-56 by a small number of dedicated Caribbean people who had come to this country determined to improve their standard of living. The justification for its existence became apparent because of the lack of available facilities where their children could have a safe and welcoming environment to play and enjoy their youth. This same group of people approached Sheffield City Council with their concerns and were able to secure a prefabricated hut at Oxford Street for use as a youth club. The club was known by the children as the ‘bug hut’. The realisation of actual needs of the Caribbean community became more prominent. Subsequently, they got together to identify a larger place to organise community meetings and functions to encourage participation in cultural and educational activities.  Our vision is to be the leading organisation in providing a voice and quality services on behalf of the African Caribbean Communities of Sheffield.
