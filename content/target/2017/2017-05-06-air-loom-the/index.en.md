The Air Loom is the first recorded account of a human Influencing Machine. Borne of the same paranoia and psychosis that characterises contemporary reports of mind control, the air loom emerges from the mind of James Tilly Matthews, a bedlam inmate who had previously been embroiled in political intrigue during the french revolution. Up until now The Air Loom existed only as drawings and writings, manifestations of Matthews psychosis.
