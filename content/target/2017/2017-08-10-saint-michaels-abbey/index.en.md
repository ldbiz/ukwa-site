St Michaelâ€™s Abbey is a little monastic community on the Hampshire-Surrey border in the south of England, about thirty miles from London. The Benedictine life has been lived here since 1895. The community is small and young. The monks live a traditional life of prayer, work and study according to the Rule of St Benedict. At the heart of their life is the dignified celebration of the daily round of the Mass and Divine Office
