Under existing EU law, there are ‘third country regimes’ already in place, which allow financial services providers from outside the EU to have access to parts of the EU financial services market.This report contains a factual matrix which provides details of: 1) the scope of the existing third country regimes – i.e. which areas of financial services are covered by third country regimes and which are not; 2) the conditions that both the UK and UK-based financial services providers would need to satisfy in order to make use of the third country regimes; and 3) the processes for securing access under the third country regimes, both to understand the obligations that the UK and UK-based financial services providers would be subject to, and to give an indication of how quickly the necessary determinations could be obtained.
