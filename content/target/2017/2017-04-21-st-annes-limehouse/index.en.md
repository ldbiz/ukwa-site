St Anne's was built between 1714-1727, one of the twelve churches built through the 1711 Act of Parliament. The church is named after Queen Anne, who initiated the scheme and raised money for it by imposing a tax on coal coming up the River Thames. The church was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, who was Sir Christopher Wren’s assistant. St Anne’s Church was successfully consecrated in 1730 and still has an active congregation today.
