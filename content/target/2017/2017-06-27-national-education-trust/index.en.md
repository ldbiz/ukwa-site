The National Education Trust plays a
leading role in the improvement of the

local, regional and national education
policy and practice through its work with
practitioners across all phases and sectors
of education. It is a leading voice in
educational debate, and is a third sector
provider of education services which have
a measurable impact on children, young
people, teachers, governors, parents and school leaders.
