The Camden History Society became the first history society in London, possibly in the country, to have researched the history of every street and district in its boundaries. Our regularly revised and expanded Streets volumes are designed as a series of walks, explaining the history of each street and describing former buildings and residents, but they can also be enjoyed from the comfort of an armchair.
