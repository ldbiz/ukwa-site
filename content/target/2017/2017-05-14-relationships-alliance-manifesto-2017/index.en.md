Government should support healthy couple, co-parenting and family relationships. A robust agenda to do so will help resolve parental conflict, reduce health demand, improve childrenâ€™s educational attainment, and ensure people can better protect themselves from shocks such as losing a job, debt, family breakdown, or long-term health conditions.
