Cofio Cwmorthin Remembered is a voluntary group dedicated to the preservation of Cwmorthinâ€™s heritage and the history of its people. It was a community of families who gathered there in the 19th Century slate-rush, joining an already established farming community. The community has now moved and all is left is an abandoned settlement.
