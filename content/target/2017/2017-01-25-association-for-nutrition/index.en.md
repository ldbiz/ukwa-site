The Association for Nutrition (AfN) defines and advances standards of evidence-based practice across the field of nutrition and at all levels within the workforce. They protect and benefit the public by:

•Championing Registrants (ANutrs/RNutrs) whose entry onto the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN) is an assurance that they meet our rigorous standards of competence and professionalism.

•Recognising high quality, relevant nutrition training through their Degree Programme Accreditation, CPD Endorsement and Certification schemes.

•Raising their profile to protect the public and raise demand for, and recognition of, the contribution of Registered Nutritionists and the wider workforce in nutrition.
