The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union—”Brexit”—will affect many aspects of the provision of health and social care in the United Kingdom. Given the range and complexity of the questions involved, the committee took evidence in advance of the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This report was intended to be the first phase of the inquiry, addressing the immediate issues faced by people, whether they are workers in health and social care or patients who rely on reciprocal healthcare arrangements.
