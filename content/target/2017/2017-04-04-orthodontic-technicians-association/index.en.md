The association was formed in 1971 following a meeting between orthodontic technicians employed in London teaching hospitals. Since then membership has grown steadily to the present level of approximately 240, representing all members of the industry. It is estimated that there are currently between 400 and 500 technicians earning their living from orthodontics in the UK.
