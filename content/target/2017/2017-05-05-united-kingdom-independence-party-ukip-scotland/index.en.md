UKIP Scotland is a libertarian political party which seeks UK withdrawal from the European Union, an organisation which is undemocratic and corrupt to the very core.
We will be at the forefront of the forthcoming campaign for the UK to exit the EU. We believe in Britain. A Britain not tied to the single market, a Britain that can make her own trade agreements and a Britain that control her own borders.
We are a patriotic and proudly unionist party,that believes in keeping our United Kingdom united.
