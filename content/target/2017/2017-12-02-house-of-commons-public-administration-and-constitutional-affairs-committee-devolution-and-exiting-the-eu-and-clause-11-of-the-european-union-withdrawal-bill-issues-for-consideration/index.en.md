Clause 11 is being interpreted by the devolved administrations as an attempt to reverse some elements of the devolution settlements. This is in spite of the UK Governments' stated intention that the European Union Withdrawal Bill (EUW) is simply designed to ensure legal continuity post-Brexit. The main source of disquiet and disagreement between central and devolved government, derives from the lack of communication and established mechanisms for both proper consultation and shared decision making between governments
