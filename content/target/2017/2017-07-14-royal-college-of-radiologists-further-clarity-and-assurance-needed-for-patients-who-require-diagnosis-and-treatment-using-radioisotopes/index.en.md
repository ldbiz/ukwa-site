The Royal College of Radiologists is seeking further reassurance from the Government that leaving Euratom will not affect the UK supply of vital diagnostic and cancer-treating materials â€“ radioisotopes. Many of these materials reach us via EU-based nuclear reactors. Anything impacting the supply and transport of radioisotopes has the potential to delay imaging scans and radiotherapy treatment.
