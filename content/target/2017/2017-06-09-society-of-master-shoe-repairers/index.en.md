The organisation was originally known as the St Crispin’s Boot Trades Association, and was formed in 1963 as a result of the amalgamation of the St Crispin’s Society of Shoemen and the National Boot Trades Association. In 1984 it’s name was changed to the Society of Master Shoe Repairers, as this was felt to be more meaningful and easily recognisable to those outside the industry. In 1997 the Society was joined by former members of the British Shoe Repair Association, and became the only national association for the shoe repair industry, representing for the first time both independent repairers and multiple companies.
