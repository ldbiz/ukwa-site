Writing West Midlands evolved from the work of the Birmingham Book Festival, established in 1999. The organisation is now the literature development agency for the region. It achieved National Portfolio Organisation status from the Arts Council in 2012; an important step which confirmed its strategic role in building the sectorâ€™s diversity and resilience. The annual festival, recently renamed Birmingham Literature Festival, remains at the heart of its work and is now the biggest literature event in the region.
