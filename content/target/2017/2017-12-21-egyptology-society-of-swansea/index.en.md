The Egyptological Society was established in 2013 by students at Swansea University studying Ancient History and Egyptology degree schemes. It is for anyone who is interested in Ancient Egypt's History and Civilisation and aims to work with the Society of Ancient Studies, Egyptology lecturers and the Egypt Centre in Swansea to aid students with their degrees and employability.
