Economists for Free Trade (EFT) is a group of leading economists, formerly known as Economists for Brexit (EfB), who believe the UKâ€™s optimal Brexit path is outside the Single Market and Customs Union, moving towards an ultimate position of global free trade as a full member of the World Trade Organisation.
