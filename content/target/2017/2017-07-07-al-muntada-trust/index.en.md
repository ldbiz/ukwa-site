Al Muntada Trust is a UK charity that describes its work as aiming "to bring communities together, through education, reducing poverty and isolation."  It is described in UK media as funded by Saudi Arabia and promoting a salafist interpretation of Islam.  It has also been accused in UK media of supporting Boko Haram in Nigeria. The Trust runs the Al Muntada School in west London.
