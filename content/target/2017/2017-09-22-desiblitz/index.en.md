The largest and multi award-winning UK based web magazine providing a unique experience of News, Gossip and Gupshup all with a Desi twist! The term ‘Desi’ refers to a connection with South Asian subcontinent roots. It is derived from the word ‘des’ or ‘desh’ which refers to ‘country’ and in this case primarily India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. ‘Desi’ has emerged as a collective term which classifies culture and people from these countries. "Core objectives include providing very selective UK, World and entertainment news,  original features, informative articles, exclusive video interviews and exposure to lifestyle, social events and cultural activities. Our growing audience is what matters most, so we strive to report, create and present the best of Desi News, Gossip and Gupshup to meet its needs, whilst maintaining high editorial and journalistic standards, which matter to us."  Based in Birmingham.
