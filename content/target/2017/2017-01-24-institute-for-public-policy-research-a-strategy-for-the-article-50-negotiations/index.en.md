Puts forward suggestions for a framework for the government’s negotiating strategy for withdrawal from the EU. The number of moving parts, complete unknowns and unanswered questions make this a fiendishly complex task. The nature of the final deal is of course impossible to ascertain at this point. So this is simply a suggested outline for the government’s opening negotiating position.

We address ten issues of particular priority.
