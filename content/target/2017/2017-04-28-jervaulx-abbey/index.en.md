Jervaulx Abbey is set in the midst of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, Jervaulx Abbey's dramatic, yet tranquil ambience has won the hearts of many of its visitors. It is one of the largest privately owned Cistercian Abbeys in England. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Jervaulx Abbey was passed down through numerous families who owned Jervaulx Hall, after years of pillage and then excavations the abbey was turned into a romantic garden for the Hall before being opened to the public.
