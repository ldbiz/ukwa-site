Reports of deadlock over Brexit negotiations might have been exaggerated, European Council President Donald Tusk said after the October 2017 European Council meeting. Progress was "not sufficient" to begin trade talks with the UK immediately but that "didn't mean there was no progress at all", he said. EU leaders were to discuss the issue internally, paving the way for talks with the UK, possibly in December. 2017.
