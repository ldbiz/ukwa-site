‘Moving to Bettws: Starting a New Life on a 1960s Estate’ is a local history project run by the Bettws in Bloom community group supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project has researched the history of the Bettws estate in Newport, South Wales, and investigate what it was like to move to the estate when it was first built in the early 1960s.
