Business voices seeking to defend the economic and social benefits of immigration for Britain in the Brexit debate have not been as effective as they need to be in that debate. Many appear not to have moved on since the referendum, saying  ‘we accept the result and the changes it will bring,’ while appearing to seek as little change as possible or to carve out protections for their own sector. New approaches will be needed if they are to be successful, in the face of increased political and media pressure for a more restrictive approach.
