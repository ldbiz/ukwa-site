This volume was written by T. E. Nicholas, or 'Niclas y Glais' when he was imprisoned at Swansea and Brixton between 11 July and 22 October 1940. Thomas Evan Nicholas (1879-1971) is described as a preacher, lecturer and dentist by occupation, but also as a poet, Socialist, Communist, pacifist and revolutionary.  He was a pioneer of the Labour movement, and one of the first members of the Communist Party in Britain, and he stood as a candidate for the Independent Labour Party in the 1918 election.
