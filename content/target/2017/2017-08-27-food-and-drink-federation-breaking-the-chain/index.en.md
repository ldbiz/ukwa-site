Ensuring the nation can be fed must be a high strategic priority for Government. The people working across our supply chain are essential to what UK consumers eat and drink. However, the public's vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has presented the sector with significant challenges and opportunities when it comes to migration and access to labour. It is hoped that by coming together and pooling data, this industry research will inform policymakers and provide appropriate solutions to the issues facing it. The main findings from the survey show that on average around a third of the food and drink supply chain's permanent workforce are EU nationals. Almost three quarters of respondents face challenges when recruiting permanent local staff and almost two thirds when looking for local seasonal/ temporary workers. If organisations across the food chain did not have access to EU nationals, over a third of respondents stated their business would become unviable.
