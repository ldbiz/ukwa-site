Low Carbon Research Institute (LCRI) was established in 2009 with funding from the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) and Welsh universities and industry. According to the site, 'the LCRI Convergence Energy Programme is a Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) programme aiming for long-term economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities for Wales. The LCRI Programme works with enterprises, including the SME sector in particular, to deliver industry-relevant new knowledge and technologies that will provide both business opportunities and help Wales deliver on its low carbon agenda'. The Institute is based at the Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University.
