Materials and Manufacturing Education Training and Learning (metal) is based within the College of Engineering at Swansea University and funded by the EUâ€™s European Social Fund, through the Welsh Government. The aim is to address a skills shortage in materials and manufacturing through the provision of work based learning leading to a general up-skilling of the workforce.
