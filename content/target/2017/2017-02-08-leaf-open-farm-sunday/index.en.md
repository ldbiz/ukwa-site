LEAF Open Farm Sunday, is managed by LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming). Since the first Open Farm Sunday in 2006, over 1500 farmers across the UK have opened their gates and welcomed 1.8 million people onto their farm for one Sunday each year. 

It is an opportunity for everyone, young and old, to discover first hand what it means to be a farmer and the work they do producing food, enhancing the countryside and all the goods and services farmers provide.

Each event is uniquely based around the farmâ€™s individual story. Activities during the day may include a farm walk, nature trail, tractor and trailer rides, demonstrations, pond dipping, activities for children, a mini farmers market or farm shop.

For the second year running, more than a quarter of a million people visited farms on Open Farm Sunday 5th June. Looking ahead to the future, LEAF launched a 10 year vision for Open Farm Sunday and Open Farm School Days in November 2014.
