Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the Foreign Office, said that the future relationship between the UK and the EU will not be negotiated within two years. Separation talks could be completed within the two year deadline set out in Article 50, but a future relationship would take longer to negotiate, he told BBC Newsnight.
