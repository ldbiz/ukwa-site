The GSA is the primary representative body for all registered postgraduate students at the University of York. Postgraduates are automatically members of the GSA, are encouraged to take part in any of our activities, and are welcome to use any of our services. So whether youâ€™re doing a Masters and here for a year, or a PhD and here for a few years, on campus or a distance learner, get to know your GSA and get involved!
