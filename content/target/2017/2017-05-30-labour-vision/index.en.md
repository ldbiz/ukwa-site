Western social democracy is in crisis. It is a crisis from which it may never recover. A perfect storm of globalisation, hyper-capitalism and right-wing populism threatens to hand the next 30 years of civilisation to politicians and other forces for whom working people are a tool and not an inspiration. Labour Vision  will share ideas about how to redress the growing structural inequality that has driven so many British people to despair and anger. Where possible, it will avoid discussing individuals, and will focus instead on issues. The hour is late, but it is not yet over. There is still time for collectivist, democratic socialist principles to once again become the principles of the British people. Labour Vision will do its best to help ensure that social democracy is not consigned to our past.
