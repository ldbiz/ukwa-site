According to the site, 'the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (the Act) is about improving the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales. It will make the public bodies listed in the Act think more about the long-term, work better with people and communities and each other, look to prevent problems and take a more joined-up approach.  This will help us to create a Wales that we all want to live in, now and in the future.'
