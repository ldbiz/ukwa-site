St Andrew & St George is a ‘cathedral-like’ Grade 2 listed building; the largest parish church to have been built in this country since World War 2. Impressive within, it has an atmosphere of prayer and welcome. The church was originally consecrated as St George’s, but was subsequently re-dedicated to St Andrew & St George in 1984, following the closure and demolition of St Andrew’s Church, nearby in Bedwell Crescent.
