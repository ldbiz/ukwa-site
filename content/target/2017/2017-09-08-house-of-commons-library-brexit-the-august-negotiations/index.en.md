What happened in the third round of Brexit negotiations from 28 to 31 August? Was any progress made in the contentious areas of citizens' rights for EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU after Brexit?

The talks did not resolve these issues, but some aspects were agreed. Will this be enough to allow a move to phase two of the negotiations in October?
