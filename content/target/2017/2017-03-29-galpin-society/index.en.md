The Galpin Society, founded in 1946, commemorates the name of Canon Francis W. Galpin (1858-1945). A much-loved parish priest, he had a lifelong interest in studying, collecting, and sometimes making musical instruments. His enthusiasm is reflected in the societyâ€™s broad remit today to promote the study of all kinds of musical instrument.
