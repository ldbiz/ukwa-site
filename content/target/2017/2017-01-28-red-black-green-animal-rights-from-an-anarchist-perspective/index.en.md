Red Black Green is produced by Paul Gravett, an anarchist, activist and writer. I have been writing about politics and society since the eighties, contributing to publications, producing leaflets, newsletters and papers for workshops. This is my first blog and it is appropriately published – just – on May 1st, International Workers’ Day, a traditional day of revolt, dissent and mischief-making!
