Founded in February 2013, The Beatfreeks Collective is a group of companies using creativity for good, based in the heart of Birmingham. At the heart of our work is a movement of people using creativity to challenge the world to be better. Our community is made up of artists, activists, entrepreneurs, designers, technologists, researchers and more. Includes: Young Giant: A youth engagement agency building ‘Institutions of the Future’ through harnessing the power of youth; we help companies and young people to connect.   Doink: A Do and Think Tank humanising data through creativity to tell extraordinary stories and facilitate better decisions.    Free Radical: An art activism platform empowering young people to tell stories about themselves, the world and how they fit together (or not).
