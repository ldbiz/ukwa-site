The Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with business, government and academia to build a framework for an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design. "Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a circular economy."   The Ellen MacArthur Foundation was established in 2010 with the aim of accelerating the transition to the circular economy. Since its creation the charity has emerged as a global thought leader, establishing the circular economy on the agenda of decision makers across business, government and academia.
