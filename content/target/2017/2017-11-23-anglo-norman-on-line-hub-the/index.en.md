The Anglo-Norman On-Line Hub is a project of the Universities of Aberystwyth and Swansea
funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council. Anglo-Norman is the name usually given to the kind of French brought over to England in 1066, then later exported to Wales, Scotland and Ireland and was still in use for complex administrative matters and affairs of state well into the 15th century. This site offers resources for understanding these records of Britain's past.
