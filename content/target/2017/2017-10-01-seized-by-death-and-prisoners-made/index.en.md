I am a Researcher of local history, not so local history and I guess history that isnâ€™t at all local.  I love to write about all this history when I can.  I like to solve mysteries of the Family History variety and help people find their ancestors. I offer a Genealogy Research Service for Kent and East Sussex, England.
