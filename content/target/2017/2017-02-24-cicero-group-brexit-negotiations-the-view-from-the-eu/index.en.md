Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed that Article 50 will be triggered no later than March 2017. Once this happens, the UK will enter into a complex and difficult negotiation in which the UKâ€™s objectives are pitted against those of 27 Member States and the European institutions. To distil the varying positions of the Member States, the Cicero Group has produced a report identifying a set of key economic, political and social variables in selected Member States that will shape their negotiating positions.
