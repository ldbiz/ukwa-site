Education Support Partnership prepared this Teacher Wellbeing Manifesto for 2017-2022 in response to alarming findings from their services, surveys and other ongoing research. This manifesto sets out five policies for the five-year Parliamentary term, which will significantly improve the wellbeing of teachers and the wider education workforce: something, which is proven to relate to student outcomes.
