Article comments on Theresa May's decision to block a second referendum on Scottish independence in 2018/19. If the Brexit  deal is a good one, that advantages May. But if Britain does get a bad deal or worse still leaves without one, Mayâ€™s decision not to fight a second referendum may age as badly as her decision not to get her own mandate while Labour was flat on its back last summer.
