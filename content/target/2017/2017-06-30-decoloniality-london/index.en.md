Decoloniality London is a London-based network committed to replacing the modern/colonial world system with justice. It aims to do this by creating both physical and intellectual spaces to facilitate the production, collation, dissemination and application of decolonial thought and praxis. "Our network is committed to forging a pluriversal future, and as such we encourage a multiplicity of approaches in our shared struggle to achieve this goal."
