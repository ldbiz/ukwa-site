A lot of laws and regulations that protect people from harmful chemicals originate in the European Union (EU). While not without its flaws, EU legislation has been responsible for a lot of progress in protecting human health in the UK over the last forty years, from improving air quality to banning BPA in babiesâ€™ bottles. We need to ensure that we build on this progress and do not let the UK slip backwards.
