Power in the Landâ€™ brings together a group of 10 artists to engage with issues of nuclear energy and the land just as the last nuclear power station in Wales, Wylfa in Anglesey closes down. Power in the Land was founded by Helen Grove-White. It is supported by the Wales Arts Council and the Welsh Government.
