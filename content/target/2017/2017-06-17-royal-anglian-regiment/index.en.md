The Royal Anglian Regiment was formed in 1964 as one of the new large infantry regiments, through the amalgamation of the regiments of the East Anglia Brigade. The Regiment is one of the most operationally experienced in the Army today, retaining very close links with the 10 counties of East Anglia and the East Midlands that it represents.
