The UK Food Group is a network of around 50 development, environment, farmer and academic organisations in the UK working on global food and agriculture issues. The diversity of membership gives a unique, dynamic and holistic perspective on food and agriculture issues.

Purpose
The UK Food Group works to strengthen advocacy in the UK, the EU, the UN and other international bodies for a global food system that can achieve our vision.

Solidarity
They are in solidarity with the networks of those most vulnerable to hunger, including movements of small-scale farmers, herders and fishers in the global South. They support their right to be part of decision making in the global food system at all levels.

Structural causes
They always try to identify the underlying causes of problems in the global food system.

Speaking out
They want to let everyone know about the many great examples of sustainable and fair approaches to agriculture and local food systems that exist. They will also speak out against unjust and environmentally reckless approaches to food and agriculture.
