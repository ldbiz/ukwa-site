Ninety-six men, women and children died as a result of the Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989. It remains the most serious tragedy in UK sporting history. Thousands suffered physical injury and/or long-term psychological harm. Twenty-three years on, the Panel has negotiated the disclosure of documents from those involved. Its analysis is published in an in-depth Report.
