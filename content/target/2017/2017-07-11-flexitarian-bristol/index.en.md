Flexitarian Bristol is a passionate group of Bristolian citizens, working with Friends of the Earth and Eating Better to ensure that our Green city doesnâ€™t overlook the dietary shift estimated to achieve the largest impacts in both public health and climate change: reducing meat and dairy and eating more vegetables and pulses.
