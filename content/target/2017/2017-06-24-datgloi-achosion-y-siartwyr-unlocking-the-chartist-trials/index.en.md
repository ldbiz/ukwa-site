Unlocking the Chartist Trials is part of the Cynefin Trails to Trials project. It aims to transcribe more than 3,000 documents that were gathered together shortly after the Chartist uprising that took place in Newport on 3rd and 4th November 1839. Cynefin partners also includes the National Library of Wales and Peopleâ€™s Collection Wales. Most of the funding is from the Heritage Lottery Fund but there is support also from The Welsh Government through CyMAL, the National Library of Wales and Archives Wales.
