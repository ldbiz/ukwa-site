The Foundation is a strategic grant-making organisation with two primary focus areas. Firstly, the Foundation is working to further venture and management education, partnering with Tel Aviv University on the Coller Institute of Venture and the Coller School of Management. Secondly, the Foundation seeks to address animal welfare and human health issues caused by factory farming through both grant-making and the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return initiative (FAIRR).
