Here’s how it works: on the day you can choose to support any charity you want in any way you want. You can choose one of our partners to support, or you can pick a totally different organisation – it’s up to you.

You choose how you want to support them. Whether you bake good stuff, make good stuff, donate good stuff, tweet good stuff or even say good stuff ‐ how you support your favourite cause is totally up to you!
