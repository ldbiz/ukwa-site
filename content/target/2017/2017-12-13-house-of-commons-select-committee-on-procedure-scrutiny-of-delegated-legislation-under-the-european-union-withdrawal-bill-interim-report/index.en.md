The Procedure Committee examined the provision made in the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill for Parliamentary scrutiny of the secondary legislation proposed to be enacted under the powers the Government claims in the Bill. It  recommends ways in which the Bill should be amended to provide for a scrutiny structure in this House adequate for the purpose, and it recommends how such a system might operate. In particular it recommends the establishment of a committee to examine the legislative changes the Government proposes and identify those of political and/or legal importance.
