The UK and the EU face a "furious race against time" to finalise Brexit talks before March 2019, according to Donald Tusk, Head of the European Council. Donald Tusk urged EU leaders to show unity as they tried to negotiate what the future relationship will look like and to set up transitional arrangements.
