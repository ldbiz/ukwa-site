he National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations (NFFO) exists to provide a voice for fishermen, irrespective of where on the coast they are based or the size of the vessel they operate. Given the scope of government to influence the conditions under which fishing vessels operate, it is vital that fishing vessels operators are able to ensure that their voice is heard and that they unite to ensure that their voice is heard clearly. The NFFO takes pride in the diversity of its membership, reflecting the diversity of the UK fleet. The organisation is run along democratic lines through an Executive Committee on which all the main regional and sectoral groupings have an equal voice. The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations is a company limited by guarantee.
