First issue (digitised) of Modern Poetry in Translation. In 1965 poets Ted Hughes and Daniel Weissbort founded a magazine. They called it Modern Poetry in Translation and in it they planned to publish the best and most insistent work available to them in English translation. The first issue featured the work of poets who were not widely known, but who have since become established names in English-language poetry, available in many translations and editions, and celebrated across the world.
