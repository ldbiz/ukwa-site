In October 2015 the Comica.London magazine website was created with the legend Comics But Not As You Know It:

To promote comics and graphic novels not just during the Comica Festival season but throughout the year.
To redress the over emphasis in all media about Superhero comics.
To put Comics in context and take nothing for granted when it comes to talking about the subject. No prior knowledge is required of anyone.
To show that comics is an amazingly rich culture all around the world enjoyed in many formsâ€”and and how it inter-relates with all aspects of the Arts.
