The Halesowen / Dudley Yemeni Community Association (H/DYCA) was first established in March 1994. It is an important community based organisation that seeks to represent and meet the particular needs of the Yemeni community in Halesowen / Dudley. It does this by providing different services at the Yemeni Community Centre in a culturally sensitive environment.

There are approximately 400 Yemeni families within the borough of Dudley, most of whom are members of H/DYCA. Yemeni people in general are low skilled and are economically disadvantaged. These disadvantages are further increased by cultural and language issues, which make it difficult for the Yemeni Community to access and take full advantage of mainstream services.
