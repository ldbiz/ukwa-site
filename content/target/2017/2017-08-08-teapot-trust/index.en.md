The Teapot Trust childrenâ€™s charity uses art therapy as a way of helping young people cope with long term medical conditions. We know that these conditions can cause anxiety, anger or upset for children and families. Art therapy provides a way of expressing and dealing with feelings, helping children to feel more in control and to cope with their condition.
