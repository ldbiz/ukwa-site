Jeremy Corbyn stood as Labour candidate for Islington North at the 2017 General Election. He was first elected to serve as the MP for Islington North in 1983 and re-elected at every subsequent general election up to and including 2017. He was elected leader of the Labour Party in September 2015. In the snap 2017 general election, Labour under Corbyn finished as the second largest party in parliament, but increased their share of the popular vote to 40%, resulting in a gain of 32 seats and a hung parliament. It was the first time Labour had made a net gain of seats since 1997, and the party's 9.6% vote gain was its largest since 1945.
