The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, also known as the Repeal Bill, was introduced to Parliament on Thursday 13 July 2017. It represents a significant milestone in the countryâ€™s journey towards leaving the EU. It is designed to provide as much certainty and continuity as possible for businesses, workers and consumers, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.
