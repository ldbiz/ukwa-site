The Worshipful Company of Management Consultants began life as a Guild of the City of London in 1993 and became a ‘Company without Livery’ in 1999.  In 2004, the Court of Aldermen granted the Company’s petition to become a fully-fledged Livery Company of the City of London, followed by the 'clothing' of our Court.
