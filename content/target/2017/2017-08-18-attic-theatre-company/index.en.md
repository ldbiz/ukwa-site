Attic makes theatre for both traditional and non-traditional theatre spaces and combines the development of new work with revivals of neglected classics. They produced a play called Fields Unsown as part of the WWI commemorations: http://www.attictheatrecompany.com/fields-unsown. Fields Unsown was a HLF project http://fieldsunsown.com/.
