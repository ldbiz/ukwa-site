This bill contains details of the government's trade policy post-Brexit. Ministers say the Trade Bill includes provisions for the UK to implement existing EU trade agreements and help ensure firms can still access foreign government contracts worth Â£1.3tn. It will also create a new trade remedies body to defend UK businesses against injurious trade practices.
