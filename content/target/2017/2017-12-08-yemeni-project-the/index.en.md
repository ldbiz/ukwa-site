Official website of The Yemeni Project, an online archive relating to the history of the South Shields Yemeni community. "It is important for everyone, whatever their nationality, whether Yemeni, Palestinian, Lebanese, or Egyptian, to know the history of their country. They need to know their history. It is important for the future"- Mohamed Al-Sayyadi, former chairman of Al Azhar Mosque, South Shields. This website is a celebration of that shared history. Written and compiled by a small group of individuals based in the North East of England, it is an archive of information for the descendants of the Yemeni community and the wider South Shields community at large.
