Community association with the mission: “to create and maximise positive opportunities for the wider community of Sandwell by providing cultural orientation, educational development and skills training for children and adults, through the provision of accessible community services and activities.” We were set up as a community group in 1989 and have evolved to meet the needs of our community through listening to the voices of our members. The Pakistani adult community living within Smethwick mainly consists of first generation Pakistanis who are illiterate in the English Language. A large majority of work is focused on ensuring these people are able to access their basic rights.
