The South Georgia Heritage Trust (SGHT) was established in 2005 to raise funds to support its two primary purposes:

To help efforts to conserve and protect those species of indigenous fauna and flora that breed and grow on South Georgia or in the surrounding seas and to raise awareness of South Georgia’s threatened species.

SGHT is registered as a charity in Scotland, with a branch in Norway and representation in the USA. It has a board of eleven international trustees, who administer SGHT funds in pursuit of SGHT’s primary purposes. The main SGHT office is in Scotland, located within Dundee’s industrial museum, Verdant Works.
