LandShare is a Social Enterprise, established to act as a catalyst for change in the way we manage land and its resources.

They say that land underpins the fundamentals of human survival; for food, fuel, shelter, and clean water.  In a finite and uncertain world securing these fundamentals will require action based on long-term thinking.   

Their work is focused on three projects:
How to feed a city 
Energy positive
Land partnerships
