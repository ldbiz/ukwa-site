The British Sign Language (BSL) Corpus is a collection of video clips showing Deaf people using BSL, together with background information about the signers and written descriptions of the signing in ELAN (annotation files will be available on this site in mid-late 2014). The video clips were collected as part of the original  BSL Corpus Project, funded between 2008 and 2011 by the Economic and Social Research Council.
