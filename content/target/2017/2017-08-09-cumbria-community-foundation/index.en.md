Cumbria Community Foundation exists to address disadvantage by making life-changing grants and promoting philanthropy. We are also here to respond to emerging need, having managed four disaster appeals, most recently raising £10.3m in response to the floods in 2015.

Provide philanthropic services to individuals, families and organisations and manage 60 grantmaking funds, supporting more than 500 community projects per year on behalf of our fundholders. Since 1999, we have invested more than £37m into almost 4,000 groups and 8,000 individuals.
