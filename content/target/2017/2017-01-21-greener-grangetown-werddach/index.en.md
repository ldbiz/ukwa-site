Greener Grangetown is a project involving City of Cardiff Council, DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water and Natural Resources Wales, supported by the Landfill Communities Fund, and is an innovative scheme to better manage rainwater in your community.The scheme will catch, clean and divert rainwater directly into the River Taff instead of pumping it over 8 miles through the Vale of Glamorgan to the sea.
