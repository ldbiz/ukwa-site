<p>Maslaha tackles the social issues affecting Muslim communities, and creates a greater understanding of Islam from a cultural and historical perspective.</p>
Maslaha creates new ways of tackling long-standing issues affecting Muslim communities. We combine imagination and craftsmanship to improve services, change attitudes and challenge systems of inequality.
