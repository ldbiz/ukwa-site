MYH is a national award winning charity that provides free and confidential faith and culturally sensitive support services targeted at vulnerable young people in the UK.

MYH was founded in August 2001 by young people to respond to the social problems endured by Muslim youth in the UK.

Our core service is a free and confidential Helpline, available nationally via the telephone, email, live chat text and letters. The service uses male and female volunteers trained in basic counselling skills to respond to client enquiries on any issue.
