<p>The UK Public Opinion Monitor is a joint initiative of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex and the University of Guelph in Canada.<br />
The monitor involves a permanent panel of 6,000 people, selected to be broadly representative of the UK population. Members of the panel are asked to answer a questionnaire every six to eight weeks. In this way, the UK Public Opinion Monitor enables the changes in the attitudes of individuals to be followed over time and related to broader individual, social and economic factors.</p>
