<p>"The Bothy Project is a network of small-scale, off-grid art residency spaces in distinct and diverse locations around Scotland and beyond. Our objective is to create platforms for artists to journey and explore the peculiarities of  the history, mythology, landscape and people in the areas surrounding the bothies. These platforms will be established through the creation of purpose built structures made in collaboration with visual artists, musicians and writers to create a network of bespoke small-scale dwellings." - from About, <a href="http://www.thebothyproject.org/welcome-to-the-bothy-project/about/">http://www.thebothyproject.org/welcome-to-the-bothy-project/about/</a></p>
