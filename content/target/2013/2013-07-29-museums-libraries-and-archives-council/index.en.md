The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) was until May 2012 a non-departmental public body and registered charity in England with a remit to promote improvement and innovation in the area of museums, libraries and archives. Its functions relating to museums, libraries and archives were transferred on 1 October 2011 to the Arts Council England and the National Archives.
