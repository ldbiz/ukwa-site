<p>A site devoted to the artist and poet (often a sound poet) Kurt Schwitters and his Merz Barn: "The Merz barn building still stands much as Schwitters left it in 1948. Located in a remote woodland in the heart of the Langdale valley in Cumbria, NW England it serves as a symbolic connection and poignant memorial to the spirit and tenacity of the artist who worked there." -- Background</p>
